    "abstract": "Estimating brain effective connectivity (EC) from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can aid in comprehending the neural mechanisms underlying human behavior and cognition, providing a foundation for disease diagnosis. However, current spatiotemporal attention modules handle temporal and spatial attention separately, extracting temporal and spatial features either sequentially or in parallel. These approach overlooks the inherent spatiotemporal correlations present in real world fMRI data. Additionally, the presence of noise in fMRI data further limits the performance of existing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel brain effective connectivity estimation method based on Fourier spatiotemporal attention (FSTA-EC), which combines Fourier attention and spatiotemporal attention to simultaneously capture inter-series (spatial) dynamics and intra-series (temporal) dependencies from high-noise fMRI data. Specifically, Fourier attention is designed to convert the high-noise fMRI data to frequency domain, and map the denoised fMRI data back to physical domain, and spatiotemporal attention is crafted to simultaneously learn spatiotemporal dynamics. Furthermore, through a series of proofs, we demonstrate that incorporating learnable filters into fast Fourier transform and inverse fast Fourier transform processes is mathematically equivalent to performing cyclic convolution. The experimental results on simulated and real-resting-state fMRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Building a predictive model based on historical Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for personalized healthcare has become an active research area. Benefiting from the powerful ability of feature extraction, deep learning (DL) approaches have achieved promising performance in many clinical prediction tasks. However, due to the lack of interpretability and trustworthiness, it is difficult to apply DL in real clinical cases of decision making. To address this, in this paper, we propose an interpretable and trustworthy predictive model~(INPREM) for healthcare. Firstly, INPREM is designed as a linear model for interpretability while encoding non-linear relationships into the learning weights for modeling the dependencies between and within each visit. This enables us to obtain the contribution matrix of the input variables, which is served as the evidence of the prediction result(s), and help physicians understand why the model gives such a prediction, thereby making the model more interpretable. Secondly, for trustworthiness, we place a random gate (which follows a Bernoulli distribution to turn on or off) over each weight of the model, as well as an additional branch to estimate data noises. With the help of the Monto Carlo sampling and an objective function accounting for data noises, the model can capture the uncertainty of each prediction. The captured uncertainty, in turn, allows physicians to know how confident the model is, thus making the model more trustworthy. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed INPREM outperforms existing approaches with a significant margin. A case study is also presented to show how the contribution matrix and the captured uncertainty are used to assist physicians in making robust decisions.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma, which can cause irreversible damage to the sight of human eyes, is conventionally diagnosed by visual field (VF) sensitivity. However, it is labor-intensive and time-consuming to measure VF. Recently, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been adopted to measure retinal layers thickness (RT) for assisting the diagnosis because glaucoma makes structural changes to RT and it is much less costly to obtain RT. In particular, RT can assist in mainly two manners. One is to estimate a VF from an RT such that clinical doctors only need to obtain an RT of a patient and then convert it to a VF for the diagnosis. The other is to predict future VFs by utilizing both past VFs and RTs, i.e., the prediction of progression of VF over time. The two computational tasks are performed as two data mining tasks because currently there is no knowledge about the exact form of the computations involved. In this paper, we study a novel problem which is the integration of the two data mining tasks. The motivation is that both the two data mining tasks deal with transforming information from the RT domain to the VF domain such that the knowledge discovered in one task can be useful for another. The integration is non-trivial because the two tasks do not share the way of transformation. To address this issue, we design a progression-agnostic and mode-independent (PAMI) module which facilitates cross-task knowledge utilization. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art method for the estimation by 6.33% in terms of mean of the root mean square error on a real dataset, and outperforms the state-of-the-art method for the progression prediction by 3.49% for the best case.",

    "abstract": "Modern health care systems are conducting continuous, automated surveillance of the electronic medical record (EMR) to identify adverse events with increasing frequency; however, many events such as sepsis do not have elucidated prodromes (i.e., event chains) that can be used to identify and intercept the adverse event early in its course. Clinically relevant and interpretable results require a framework that can (i) infer temporal interactions across multiple patient features found in EMR data (e.g., Labs, vital signs, etc.) and (ii) identify patterns that precede and are specific to an impending adverse event (e.g., sepsis). In this work, we propose a linear multivariate Hawkes process model, coupled with ReLU link function, to recover a Granger Causal (GC) graph with both exciting and inhibiting effects. We develop a scalable two-phase gradient-based method to obtain a maximum surrogate-likelihood estimator, which is shown to be effective via extensive numerical simulation. Our method is subsequently extended to a data set of patients admitted to Grady hospital system in Atlanta, GA, USA, where the estimated GC graph identifies several highly interpretable GC chains that precede sepsis.

    "abstract": "Molecular pre-training, which is about to learn an effective representation for molecules on large amount of data, has attracted substantial attention in cheminformatics and bioinformatics. A molecule can be viewed as either a graph (where atoms are connected by bonds) or a SMILES sequence (where depth-first-search is applied to the molecular graph with specific rules). The Transformer and graph neural networks (GNN) are two representative methods to deal with the sequential data and the graphic data, which can globally and locally model the molecules respectively and are supposed to be complementary. In this work, we propose to leverage both representations and design a new pre-training algorithm, dual-view molecule pre-training (briefly, DVMP), that can effectively combine the strengths of both types of molecule representations. DVMP has a Transformer branch and a GNN branch, and the two branches are pre-trained to maintain the semantic consistency of molecules. After pre-training, we can use either the Transformer branch (this one is recommended according to empirical results), the GNN branch, or both for downstream tasks. DVMP is tested on 11 molecular property prediction tasks and outperforms strong baselines. Furthermore, we test DVMP on three retrosynthesis tasks and it achieves state-of-the-art results.

    "abstract": "Medical diagnosis through artificial intelligence has been drawing increasing attention currently. For breast lesions, the clinical ultrasound reports are the most commonly used data in the diagnosis of breast cancer. Nevertheless, the input reports always encounter the inevitable issue of data missing. Unfortunately, despite the efforts made in previous approaches that made progress on tackling data imprecision, nearly all of these approaches cannot accept inputs with data missing. A common way to alleviate the data missing issue is to fill the missing values with artificial data. However, the data filling strategy actually brings in additional noises that do not exist in the raw data. Inspired by the advantage of open world assumption, we regard the missing data in clinical ultrasound reports as non-observed terms of facts, and propose a Knowledge Graph embedding based model KGSeD with the capability of tolerating data missing, which can successfully circumvent the pollution caused by data filling. Our KGSeD is designed via an encoder-decoder framework, where the encoder incorporates structural information of the graph via embedding, and the decoder diagnose patients by inferring their links to clinical outcomes. Comparative experiments show that KGSeD achieves noticeable diagnosis performances. When data missing occurred, KGSeD yields the most stable performance over those of existing approaches, showing better tolerance to data missing.",

    "abstract": "Spatial networks represent crucial data structures where the nodes and edges are embedded in a geometric space. Nowadays, spatial network data is becoming increasingly popular and important, ranging from microscale (e.g., protein structures), to middle-scale (e.g., biological neural networks), to macro-scale (e.g., mobility networks). Although, modeling and understanding the generative process of spatial networks are very important, they remain largely under-explored due to the significant challenges in automatically modeling and distinguishing the independency and correlation among various spatial and network factors. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel objective for joint spatial-network disentanglement from the perspective of information bottleneck as well as a novel optimization algorithm to optimize the intractable objective. Based on this, a spatial-network variational autoencoder (SND-VAE) with a new spatial-network message passing neural network (S-MPNN) is proposed to discover the independent and dependent latent factors of spatial and networks. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-arts by up to 66.9% for graph generation and 37.3% for interpretability.",

    "abstract": "The aging of global population is witnessing increasing prevalence of spinal disorders. According to latest statistics, nearly five percent of the global population is suffering from spinal disorders. To relieve the pain, many spine patients tend to choose surgeries. However, recent evidences reveal that some spine patients can self-heal over time with nonoperative treatment and even surgeries may not ease the pain for some others, which raises a critical question regarding the appropriateness of such surgeries. Furthermore, the complex and time-consuming diagnostic process places a great burden on both clinicians and patients. Due to the development of web technology, it is possible for spine patients to obtain decision making suggestions on the Internet. The uniqueness of web technology, including its popularity, convenience, and immediacy, makes intelligent healthcare techniques, especially Treatment Outcome Forecasting (TOF), able to support clinical decision-making for doctors and healthcare providers. Despite a few machine-learning-based methods have been proposed for TOF, their performance and feasibility are mostly unsatisfactory due to the neglect of a few practical challenges (caused by applying on the Internet), including biased data selection, noisy supervision, and patient noncompliance. In light of this, we propose DeepTOF, a novel end-to-end deep learning model to cope with the unique challenges in web-based long-term continuous spine TOF. In particular, we combine different patient groups and train a unified predictive model to eliminate the data selection bias. Towards robust learning, we further take advantage of indirect but fine-grained supervision signals to mutually calibrate with the noisy training labels. Additionally, a feature selector was co-trained with DeepTOF to select the most important features (i.e., answers/indicators that need to be collected) for inference, thus easing the use of DeepTOF during web-based real-world application. The proposed DeepTOF could bring great benefits to the rehabilitation of spine patients. Comprehensive experiments and analysis show that DeepTOF outperforms conventional solutions by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a rapid growth of utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) in the biomedical domain for tackling drug-related problems. However, like any other deep architectures, GNNs are data hungry. While requiring labels in real world is often expensive, pretraining GNNs in an unsupervised manner has been actively explored. Among them, graph contrastive learning, by maximizing the mutual information between paired graph augmentations, has been shown to be effective on various downstream tasks. However, the current graph contrastive learning framework has two limitations. First, the augmentations are designed for general graphs and thus may not be suitable or powerful enough for certain domains. Second, the contrastive scheme only learns representations that are invariant to local perturbations and thus does not consider the global structure of the dataset, which may also be useful for downstream tasks. In this paper, we study graph contrastive learning designed specifically for the biomedical domain, where molecular graphs are present. We propose a novel framework called MoCL, which utilizes domain knowledge at both local- and global-level to assist representation learning. The local-level domain knowledge guides the augmentation process such that variation is introduced without changing graph semantics. The global-level knowledge encodes the similarity information between graphs in the entire dataset and helps to learn representations with richer semantics. The entire model is learned through a double contrast objective. We evaluate MoCL on various molecular datasets under both linear and semi-supervised settings and results show that MoCL achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

We model the case where there exists heterogeneous non-compliance to a randomly assigned treatment, a typical situation in health (because of non-compliance to prescription) or digital advertising (because of competition and ad blockers for instance). The lower the compliance, the more the effect of treatment prescription - or individual prescription effect (IPE) - signal fades away and becomes harder to estimate. We propose a new approach for the estimation of the IPE that takes advantage of observed compliance information to prevent signal fading. Using the Structural Causal Model framework and do-calculus, we define a general mediated causal effect setting and propose a corresponding estimator which consistently recovers the IPE with asymptotic variance guarantees. Finally, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets that highlight the benefit of the approach, which consistently improves state-of-the-art in low compliance settings.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHR) data, deep learning techniques have been broadly utilized for various health prediction tasks. Nevertheless, the labeled data scarcity issue restricts the prediction power of these deep models. To enhance the generalization capability of deep learning models when faced with such situations, a common trend is to train generative adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models for data augmentation. However, due to limitations in sample size and potential label imbalance issues, these methods are prone to mode collapse problems. This results in the generation of new samples that fail to preserve the subtype structure within EHR data, thereby limiting their practicality in health prediction tasks that generally require detailed patient phenotyping. Aiming at the above problems, we propose a <u>Proto</u>type-based <u>Mix</u>up method, dubbed ProtoMix, which combines prior knowledge of intrinsic data features from subtype centroids (i.e., prototypes) to guide the synthesis of new samples. Specifically, ProtoMix employs a prototype-guided mixup training task to shift the decision boundary away from the subtypes. Then, ProtoMix optimizes the sampling weights in different areas of the data manifold via a prototype-guided mixup sampling strategy. Throughout the training process, ProtoMix dynamically expands the training distribution using an adaptive mixing coefficient computation method. Experimental evaluations on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of ProtoMix.",

    "abstract": "Opioids (e.g., oxycodone and morphine) are highly addictive prescription (aka Rx) drugs which can be easily overprescribed and lead to opioid overdose. Recently, the opioid epidemic is increasingly serious across the US as its related deaths have risen at alarming rates. To combat the deadly opioid epidemic, a state-run prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) has been established to alleviate the drug over-prescribing problem in the US. Although PDMP provides a detailed prescription history related to opioids, it is still not enough to prevent opioid overdose because it cannot predict over-prescribing risk. In addition, existing machine learning-based methods mainly focus on drug doses while ignoring other prescribing patterns behind patients' historical records, thus resulting in suboptimal performance. To this end, we propose a novel model DDHGNN - Disentangled Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, for over-prescribing prediction. Specifically, we abstract the PDMP data into a dynamic heterogeneous graph which comprehensively depicts the prescribing and dispensing (P&D) relationships. Then, we design a dynamic heterogeneous graph neural network to learn patients' representations. Furthermore, we devise an adversarial disentangler to learn a disentangled representation which is particularly related to the prescribing patterns. Extensive experiments on a 1-year anonymous PDMP data demonstrate that DDHGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, revealing its promising future in preventing opioid overdose.",

    "abstract": "Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a crucial radiotherapy technique, which is often formulated as an optimization problem. However, when the constraints are too restrictive to provide a feasible solution, human planners resort to relaxing the optimization parameters and re-evaluating the problem until an acceptable solution is obtained. However, this process is laborious and time-consuming, which has prompted attempts to automate radiotherapy through inverse planning studies using reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, these studies face two major limitations. First, a separate sub-network must be designed for each organ, rendering it difficult to apply to patients with an inconsistent number of structures. Second, the low signal-to-noise input and discrete action space result in low training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose an organ-sharing network that contains a functional embedding layer to extract curve features of the dose-volume histogram. It outputs continuous actions that can adjust the optimization parameters, thereby automating the radiotherapy planning process. The results from a cervical cancer dataset demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed model in real-world radiotherapy. The code is available on https://github.com/Cissise/FatPIN.",

While numerical chromosome abnormalities can be quickly and precisely detected, structural chromosome abnormalities are far more complex and typically require considerable efforts by human experts for identification. This paper focuses on investigating the modeling of chromosome features and the identification of chromosomes with structural abnormalities. Most existing data-driven methods concentrate on a single chromosome and consider each chromosome independently, overlooking the crucial aspect of homologous chromosomes. In normal cases, homologous chromosomes share identical structures, with the exception that one of them is abnormal. Therefore, we propose an adaptive method to align homologous chromosomes and diagnose structural abnormalities through homologous similarity. Inspired by the process of human expert diagnosis, we incorporate information from multiple pairs of homologous chromosomes simultaneously, aiming to reduce noise disturbance and improve prediction performance. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our model compared to baselines.",

    "abstract": "Representation learning of protein 3D structures is challenging and essential for applications, e.g., computational protein design or protein engineering. Recently, geometric deep learning has achieved great success in non-Euclidean domains. Although protein can be represented as a graph naturally, it remains under-explored mainly due to the significant challenges in modeling the complex representations and capturing the inherent correlation in the 3D structure modeling. Several challenges include: 1) It is challenging to extract and preserve multi-level rotation and translation equivariant information during learning. 2) Difficulty in developing appropriate tools to effectively leverage the input spatial representations to capture complex geometries across the spatial dimension. 3) Difficulty in incorporating various geometric features and preserving the inherent structural relations. In this work, we introduce geometric bottleneck perceptron, and a general SO(3)-equivariant message passing neural network built on top of it for protein structure representation learning. The proposed geometric bottleneck perceptron can be incorporated into diverse network architecture backbones to process geometric data in different domains. This research shed new light on geometric deep learning in 3D structure studies. Empirically, we demonstrate the strength of our proposed approach on three core downstream tasks, where our model achieves significant improvements and outperforms existing benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Brain extraction, registration and segmentation are indispensable preprocessing steps in neuroimaging studies. The aim is to extract the brain from raw imaging scans (i.e., extraction step), align it with a target brain image (i.e., registration step) and label the anatomical brain regions (i.e., segmentation step). Conventional studies typically focus on developing separate methods for the extraction, registration and segmentation tasks in a supervised setting. The performance of these methods is largely contingent on the quantity of training samples and the extent of visual inspections carried out by experts for error correction. Nevertheless, collecting voxel-level labels and performing manual quality control on high-dimensional neuroimages (e.g., 3D MRI) are expensive and time-consuming in many medical studies. In this paper, we study the problem of one-shot joint extraction, registration and segmentation in neuroimaging data, which exploits only one labeled template image (a.k.a. atlas) and a few unlabeled raw images for training. We propose a unified end-to-end framework, called JERS, to jointly optimize the extraction, registration and segmentation tasks, allowing feedback among them. Specifically, we use a group of extraction, registration and segmentation modules to learn the extraction mask, transformation and segmentation mask, where modules are interconnected and mutually reinforced by self-supervision. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method performs exceptionally in the extraction, registration and segmentation tasks.",

    "abstract": "As the application of deep neural networks proliferates in numerous areas such as medical imaging, video surveillance, and self driving cars, the need for explaining the decisions of these models has become a hot research topic, both at the global and local level. Locally, most explanation methods have focused on identifying relevance of features, limiting the types of explanations possible. In this paper, we investigate a new direction by leveraging latent features to generate contrastive explanations; predictions are explained not only by highlighting aspects that are in themselves sufficient to justify the classification, but also by new aspects which if added will change the classification. The key contribution of this paper lies in how we add features to rich data in a formal yet humanly interpretable way that leads to meaningful results. Our new definition of \"addition\" uses latent features to move beyond the limitations of previous explanations and resolve an open question laid out in Dhurandhar, et. al. (2018), which creates local contrastive explanations but is limited to simple datasets such as grayscale images. The strength of our approach in creating intuitive explanations that are also quantitatively superior to other methods is demonstrated on three diverse image datasets (skin lesions, faces, and fashion apparel). A user study with 200 participants further exemplifies the benefits of contrastive information, which can be viewed as complementary to other state-of-the-art interpretability methods.",

    "abstract": "DNA-stabilized silver nanoclusters (AgN-DNAs) are a class of nanomaterials comprised of 10-30 silver atoms held together by short synthetic DNA template strands. AgN-DNAs are promising biosensors and fluorophores due to their small sizes, natural compatibility with DNA, and bright fluorescence---the property of absorbing light and re-emitting light of a different color. The sequence of the DNA template acts as a \"genome\" for AgN-DNAs, tuning the size of the encapsulated silver nanocluster, and thus its fluorescence color. However, current understanding of the AgN-DNA genome is still limited. Only a minority of DNA sequences produce highly fluorescent AgN-DNAs, and the bulky DNA strands and complex DNA-silver interactions make it challenging to use first principles chemical calculations to understand and design AgN-DNAs. Thus, a major challenge for researchers studying these nanomaterials is to develop methods to employ observational data about studied AgN-DNAs to design new nanoclusters for targeted applications. In this work, we present an approach to design AgN-DNAs by employing variational autoencoders (VAEs) as generative models. Specifically, we employ an LSTM-based β-VAE architecture and regularize its latent space to correlate with AgN-DNA properties such as color and brightness. The regularization is adaptive to skewed sample distributions of available observational data along our design axes of properties. We employ our model for design of AgN-DNAs in the near-infrared (NIR) band, where relatively few AgN-DNAs have been observed to date. Wet lab experiments validate that when employed for designing new AgN-DNAs, our model significantly shifts the distribution of AgN-DNA colors towards the NIR while simultaneously achieving bright fluorescence. This work shows that VAE-based generative models are well-suited for the design of AgN-DNAs with multiple targeted properties, with significant potential to advance the promising applications of these nanomaterials for bioimaging, biosensing, and other critical technologies.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is closely associated with an increased risk of suicide. However, while the prior work has revealed valuable insight into understanding the behavior of BD patients on social media, little attention has been paid to developing a model that can predict the future suicidality of a BD patient. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-task learning model for predicting the future suicidality of BD patients by jointly learning current symptoms. We build a novel BD dataset clinically validated by psychiatrists, including 14 years of posts on bipolar-related subreddits written by 818 BD patients, along with the annotations of future suicidality and BD symptoms. We also suggest a temporal symptom-aware attention mechanism to determine which symptoms are the most influential for predicting future suicidality over time through a sequence of BD posts. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in both BD symptom identification and future suicidality prediction tasks. In addition, the proposed temporal symptom-aware attention provides interpretable attention weights, helping clinicians to apprehend BD patients more comprehensively and to provide timely intervention by tracking mental state progression.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data can offer a holistic assessment of a patient's health status, supporting various predictive healthcare tasks. Recently, several studies have embraced the multitask learning approach in the healthcare domain, exploiting the inherent correlations among clinical tasks to predict multiple outcomes simultaneously. However, existing methods necessitate samples to possess complete labels for all tasks, which places heavy demands on the data and restricts the flexibility of the model. Meanwhile, within a multitask framework with multimodal inputs, how to comprehensively consider the information disparity among modalities and among tasks still remains a challenging problem. To tackle these issues, a unified healthcare prediction model, also named by FlexCare, is proposed to flexibly accommodate incomplete multimodal inputs, promoting the adaption to multiple healthcare tasks. The proposed model breaks the conventional paradigm of parallel multitask prediction by decomposing it into a series of asynchronous single-task prediction. Specifically, a task-agnostic multimodal information extraction module is presented to capture decorrelated representations of diverse intra- and inter-modality patterns. Taking full account of the information disparities between different modalities and different tasks, we present a task-guided hierarchical multimodal fusion module that integrates the refined modality-level representations into an individual patient-level representation. Experimental results on multiple tasks from MIMIC-IV/MIMIC-CXR/MIMIC-NOTE datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, further analysis underscores the feasibility and potential of employing such a multitask strategy in the healthcare domain.

In this paper, we present a material industry-oriented web platform of an AI-driven molecular inverse-design system, which automatically designs brand new molecular structures rapidly and diversely. Different from existing inverse-design solutions, in this system, the combination of substructure-based feature encoding and molecular graph generation algorithms allows a user to gain high-speed, interpretable, and customizable design process. Also, a hierarchical data structure and user-oriented UI provide a flexible and intuitive workflow. The system is deployed on IBM's and our client's cloud servers and has been used by 5 partner companies. To illustrate actual industrial use cases, we exhibit inverse-design of sugar and dye molecules, that were carried out by experimental chemists in those client companies. Compared to a general human chemist's standard performance, the molecular design speed was accelerated more than 10 times, and greatly increased variety was observed in the inverse-designed molecules without loss of chemical realism.",

    "abstract": "Medical ontologies are widely used to describe and organize medical terminologies and to support many critical applications on healthcare databases. These ontologies are often manually curated (e.g., UMLS, SNOMED CT, and MeSH) by medical experts. Medical databases, on the other hand, are often created by database administrators, using different terminology and structures. The discrepancies between medical ontologies and databases compromise interoperability between them. Data to ontology matching is the process of finding semantic correspondences between tables in databases to standard ontologies. Existing solutions such as ontology matching have mostly focused on engineering features from terminological, structural, and semantic model information extracted from the ontologies. However, this is often labor intensive and the accuracy varies greatly across different ontologies. Worse yet, the ontology capturing a medical database is often not given in practice. In this paper, we propose MEDTO, a novel end-to-end framework that consists of three innovative techniques: (1) a lightweight yet effective method that bootstrap a semantically rich ontology from a given medical database, (2) a hyperbolic graph convolution layer that encodes hierarchical concepts in the hyperbolic space, and (3) a heterogeneous graph layer that encodes both local and global context information of a concept. Experiments on two real-world medical datasets matching against SNOMED CT show significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art methods. MEDTO also consistently achieves competitive results on a benchmark from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, automatic computational systems based on deep learning are widely used in medical fields, such as automatic diagnosing and disease prediction. Most of these systems are designed for data sufficient scenarios. However, due to the disease rarity or privacy, the medical data are always insufficient. When applying these data-hungry deep learning models with insufficient data, it is likely to lead to issues of over-fitting and cause serious performance problems. Many data augmentation methods have been proposed to solve the data insufficiency problem, such as using GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) to generate training data. However, the augmented data usually contains lots of noise. Directly using them to train sensitive medical models is very difficult to achieve satisfactory results. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel deep model learning method for insufficient EHR (Electronic Health Record) data modeling, namely GRACE, which stands GeneRative Adversarial networks enhanCed prE-training. In the method, we propose an item-relation-aware GAN to capture changing trends and correlations among data for generating high-quality EHR records. Furthermore, we design a pre-training mechanism consisting of a masked records prediction task and a real-fake contrastive learning task to learn representations for EHR data using both generated and real data. After the pre-training, only the representations of real data is used to train the final prediction model. In this way, we can fully exploit useful information in generated data through pre-training, and also avoid the problems caused by directly using noisy generated data to train the final prediction model.

    "abstract": "Given an irregular tensor from a newly emerging domain, how can we quickly and accurately capture its patterns utilizing existing irregular tensors in multiple domains? The problem is of great importance for various tasks such as finding patterns of a new disease using pre-existing diseases data. This is challenging as new target tensors have limited information due to their recent emergence. Thus, carefully utilizing the existing source tensors for analyzing the target tensor is helpful. PARAFAC2 decomposition is a strong tool for finding the patterns of irregular tensors, and the patterns are used in many applications such as missing value prediction and anomaly detection. However, previous PARAFAC2-based works cannot adaptably handle newly emerging target tensors utilizing the source tensors. In this work, we propose Meta-P2, a fast and accurate domain adaptation method for irregular tensor decomposition. Meta-P2 generates a meta factor matrix from the multiple source domains, by domain adaptation and meta-update steps. Meta-P2 quickly and accurately finds the patterns of the new irregular tensor utilizing the meta factor matrix. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that Meta-P2 achieves the best performance in various downstream tasks including missing value prediction and anomaly detection tasks.",

Among others, inverse protein folding is a fundamental task in protein design, which aims at generating protein's amino acid sequence given a 3D graph structure. However, most existing methods for inverse protein folding are based on sequential generative models and therefore limited in uncertainty quantification and exploration ability to the entire protein space. To address the issues, we propose a sampling method for inverse protein folding (SIPF). Specifically, we formulate inverse protein folding as a sampling problem and design two pretrained neural networks as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposal distribution. To ensure sampling efficiency, we further design (i) an adaptive sampling scheme to select variables for sampling and (ii) an approximate target distribution as a surrogate of the unavailable target distribution. Empirical studies have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of SIPF, achieving 7.4% relative improvement on recovery rate and 6.4% relative reduction in perplexity compared to the best baseline.",

First, conduct a dimension reduction of the input cell profile matrix; second, cluster the cells in the latent space; and third, extract the \"gene panels\" that distinguish a certain cluster from others. This workflow has the primary drawback that the three steps are performed independently, neglecting the dependencies among the steps and among the marker genes or gene panels. In our system, KRATOS, we alter the three-step workflow to a two-step one, where we jointly optimize the first two steps and add the third (interpretability) step to form an integrated sc-RNA-seq analysis pipeline. We show that the more compact workflow of KRATOS extracts marker genes that can better discriminate the target cluster, distilling underlying mechanisms guiding cluster membership. In doing so, KRATOS is significantly better than the two SOTA baselines we compare against, specifically 5.62% superior to Global Counterfactual Explanation (GCE) [ICML-20], and 3.31% better than Adversarial Clustering Explanation (ACE) [ICML-21], measured by the AUROC of a kernel-SVM classifier.

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the challenge of reconstructing the complete 12-lead ECG signal from its incomplete parts. We focus on two main scenarios: (i) reconstructing missing signal segments within an ECG lead and (ii) recovering entire leads from signal in another unique lead. Two emerging clinical applications emphasize the relevance of our work. The first is the increasing need to digitize paper-stored ECGs for utilization in AI-based applications, often limited to digital 12 lead 10s ECGs. The second is the widespread use of wearable devices that record ECGs but typically capture only one or a few leads. In both cases, a non-negligible amount of information is lost or not recorded. Our approach aims to recover this missing signal. We propose ECGrecover, a U-Net neural network model trained on a novel composite objective function to address the reconstruction problem. This function incorporates both spatial and temporal features of the ECG by combining the distance in amplitude and sycnhronization through time between the reconstructed and the real digital signals. We used real-life ECG datasets and through comprehensive assessments compared ECGrecover with three state-of-the-art methods based on generative adversarial networks (EKGAN, Pix2Pix) as well as the CopyPaste strategy. The results demonstrated that ECGrecover consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in standard distortion metrics as well as in preserving critical ECG characteristics, particularly the P, QRS, and T wave coordinates.",

    "abstract": "Estimation of treatment efficacy of real-world clinical interventions involves working with continuous time-to-event outcomes such as time-to-death, re-hospitalization, or a composite event that may be subject to censoring. Counterfactual reasoning in such scenarios requires decoupling the effects of confounding physiological characteristics that affect baseline survival rates from the effects of the interventions being assessed. In this paper, we present a latent variable approach to model heterogeneous treatment effects by proposing that an individual can belong to one of latent clusters with distinct response characteristics. We show that this latent structure can mediate the base survival rates and help determine the effects of an intervention. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to discover actionable phenotypes of individuals based on their treatment response on multiple large randomized clinical trials originally conducted to assess appropriate treatment strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk.",

    "abstract": "Molecular property prediction (e.g., energy) is an essential problem in chemistry and biology. Unfortunately, many supervised learning methods usually suffer from the problem of scarce labeled molecules in the chemical space, where such property labels are generally obtained by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation which is extremely computational costly. An effective solution is to incorporate the unlabeled molecules in a semi-supervised fashion. However, learning semi-supervised representation for large amounts of molecules is challenging, including the joint representation issue of both molecular essence and structure, the conflict between representation and property leaning. Here we propose a novel framework called Active Semi-supervised Graph Neural Network (ASGN) by incorporating both labeled and unlabeled molecules. Specifically, ASGN adopts a teacher-student framework. In the teacher model, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning method to learn general representation that jointly exploits information from molecular structure and molecular distribution. Then in the student model, we target at property prediction task to deal with the learning loss conflict. At last, we proposed a novel active learning strategy in terms of molecular diversities to select informative data during the whole framework learning. We conduct extensive experiments on several public datasets. Experimental results show the remarkable performance of our ASGN framework.",

Which restaurant shall we recommend to a given user at the right time at the right location? Given a disease, which genes and drugs are most relevant? Multi-way association, which identifies strongly correlated node sets from multiple input networks, is the key to answering these questions. Despite its importance, very few multi-way association methods exist due to its high complexity. In this paper, we formulate multi-way association as a convex optimization problem, whose optimal solution can be obtained by a Sylvester tensor equation. Furthermore, we propose two fast algorithms to solve the Sylvester tensor equation, with a linear time and space complexity. We further provide theoretic analysis in terms of the sensitivity of the Sylvester tensor equation solution. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Standard modern machine-learning-based imaging methods have faced challenges in medical applications due to the high cost of dataset construction and, thereby, the limited labeled training data available. Additionally, upon deployment, these methods are usually used to process a large volume of data on a daily basis, imposing a high maintenance cost on medical facilities. In this paper, we introduce a new neural network architecture, termed LoGoNet, with a tailored self-supervised learning (SSL) method to mitigate such challenges. LoGoNet integrates a novel feature extractor within a U-shaped architecture, leveraging Large Kernel Attention (LKA) and a dual encoding strategy to capture both long-range and short-range feature dependencies adeptly. This is in contrast to existing methods that rely on increasing network capacity to enhance feature extraction. This combination of novel techniques in our model is especially beneficial in medical image segmentation, given the difficulty of learning intricate and often irregular body organ shapes, such as the spleen. Complementary, we propose a novel SSL method tailored for 3D images to compensate for the lack of large labeled datasets. Our method combines masking and contrastive learning techniques within a multi-task learning framework and is compatible with both Vision Transformer (ViT) and CNN-based models. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods in numerous tasks across two standard datasets (i.e., BTCV and MSD). Benchmark comparisons with eight state-of-the-art models highlight LoGoNet's superior performance in both inference time and accuracy. Code available at: https://github.com/aminK8/Masked-LoGoNet.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the counterfactual outcome of treatment is essential for decision-making in public health and clinical science, among others. Often, treatments are administered in a sequential, time-varying manner, leading to an exponentially increased number of possible counterfactual outcomes. Furthermore, in modern applications, the outcomes are high-dimensional and conventional average treatment effect estimation fails to capture disparities in individuals. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel conditional generative framework capable of producing counterfactual samples under time-varying treatment, without the need for explicit density estimation. Our method carefully addresses the distribution mismatch between the observed and counterfactual distributions via a loss function based on inverse probability re-weighting, and supports integration with state-of-the-art conditional generative models such as the guided diffusion and conditional variational autoencoder. We present a thorough evaluation of our method using both synthetic and real-world data. Our results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating high-quality counterfactual samples and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Molecular lead optimization is an important task of drug discovery focusing on generating novel molecules similar to a drug candidate but with enhanced properties. Prior works focused on supervised models requiring datasets of pairs of a molecule and an enhanced molecule. These approaches require large amounts of data and are limited by the bias of the specific examples of enhanced molecules. In this work, we present an unsupervised generative approach with a molecule-embedding component that maps a discrete representation of a molecule to a continuous space. The components are then coupled with a unique training architecture leveraging molecule fingerprints and applying double cycle constraints to enable both chemical resemblance to the original molecular lead while generating novel molecules with enhanced properties. We evaluate our method on multiple common molecular optimization tasks, including dopamine receptor (DRD2) and drug likeness (QED), and show our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we conduct thorough ablation experiments to show the effect and necessity of important components in our model. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method's ability to generate FDA-approved drugs it has never encountered before, such as Perazine and Clozapine, which are used to treat psychotic disorders, like Schizophrenia. The system is currently being deployed for use in the Targeted Drug Delivery and Personalized Medicine laboratories generating treatments using nanoparticle-based technology.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials play important roles in drug development but often suffer from expensive, inaccurate and insufficient patient recruitment. The availability of massive electronic health records (EHR) data and trial eligibility criteria (EC) bring a new opportunity to data driven patient recruitment. One key task named patient-trial matching is to find qualified patients for clinical trials given structured EHR and unstructured EC text (both inclusion and exclusion criteria). How to match complex EC text with longitudinal patient EHRs? How to embed many-to-many relationships between patients and trials? How to explicitly handle the difference between inclusion and exclusion criteria? In this paper, we proposed CrOss-Modal PseudO-SiamEse network (COMPOSE) to address these challenges for patient-trial matching. One path of the network encodes EC using convolutional highway network. The other path processes EHR with multi-granularity memory network that encodes structured patient records into multiple levels based on medical ontology. Using the EC embedding as query, COMPOSE performs attentional record alignment and thus enables dynamic patient-trial matching. COMPOSE also introduces a composite loss term to maximize the similarity between patient records and inclusion criteria while minimize the similarity to the exclusion criteria. Experiment results show COMPOSE can reach 98.0% AUC on patient-criteria matching and 83.7% accuracy on patient-trial matching, which leads 24.3% improvement over the best baseline on real-world patient-trial matching tasks.",

    "abstract": "Heart is the most important organ of the human body, and Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential tool for clinical monitoring of heart health and detecting cardiovascular diseases. Automatic detection of ECG anomalies is of great significance and clinical value in healthcare. However, performing automatic anomaly detection for the ECG data is challenging because we not only need to accurately detect the anomalies but also need to provide clinically meaningful interpretation of the results. Existing works on automatic ECG anomaly detection either rely on hand-crafted designs of feature extraction algorithms which are typically too simple to deliver good performance, or deep learning for automatically extracting features, which is not interpretable. In this paper, we propose ECGGAN, a novel reconstruction-based ECG anomaly detection framework. The key idea of ECGGAN is to make full use of the characteristics of ECG with the periodic metadata, namely beat, to learn the universal pattern in ECG from representative normal data. We establish a reconstruction model, taking leads as constraints to capture the unique characteristics of different leads in ECG data, and achieve accurate anomaly detection at ECG-level by combining multiple leads. Experimental results on two real-world datasets and their mixed-set confirm that our method achieves superior performance than baselines in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. In addition, ECGGAN can provide clinically meaningful interpretation of results by revealing the extent to which abnormal sites deviate from the normal pattern.",

Current datasets for training deep learning models of this purpose remain constrained without diverse TCRs and peptides. To combat the data scarcity issue presented in the current datasets, we propose to extend the training dataset by physical modeling of TCR-peptide pairs. Specifically, we compute the docking energies between auxiliary unknown TCR-peptide pairs as surrogate training labels. Then, we use these extended example-label pairs to train our model in a supervised fashion. Finally, we find that the AUC score for the prediction of the model can be further improved by pseudo-labeling of such unknown TCR-peptide pairs (by a trained teacher model), and re-training the model with those pseudo-labeled TCR-peptide pairs. Our proposed method that trains the deep neural network with physical modeling and data-augmented pseudo-labeling improves over baselines in the available two datasets. We also introduce a new dataset that contains over 80,000 unknown TCR-peptide pairs with docking energy scores.",

Recently, geometric deep learning has achieved great success on non-Euclidean domains including social networks, chemistry, and computer graphics. Although it is natural to present protein structures as 3D graphs, existing research has rarely studied protein structures as graphs directly. The present research explores the geometry deep learning of three-dimensional graphs on protein structures and proposes a graph neural network architecture to address these challenges. The proposed Protein Geometric Graph Neural Network (PG-GNN) models both distance geometric graph representation and dihedral geometric graph representation by geometric graph convolutions. This research shed new light on protein 3D structure studies. We investigated the effectiveness of graph neural networks over five real datasets.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become the de facto training paradigm of large models, where pre-training is followed by supervised fine-tuning using domain-specific data and labels. Despite demonstrating comparable performance with supervised methods, comprehensive efforts to assess SSL's impact on machine learning fairness (i.e., performing equally on different demographic breakdowns) are lacking. Hypothesizing that SSL models would learn more generic, hence less biased representations, this study explores the impact of pre-training and fine-tuning strategies on fairness. We introduce a fairness assessment framework for SSL, comprising five stages: defining dataset requirements, pre-training, fine-tuning with gradual unfreezing, assessing representation similarity conditioned on demographics, and establishing domain-specific evaluation processes. We evaluate our method's generalizability on three real-world human-centric datasets (i.e., MIMIC, MESA, and GLOBEM) by systematically comparing hundreds of SSL and fine-tuned models on various dimensions spanning from the intermediate representations to appropriate evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate that SSL can significantly improve model fairness, while maintaining performance on par with supervised methods-exhibiting up to a 30% increase in fairness with minimal loss in performance through self-supervision. We posit that such differences can be attributed to representation dissimilarities found between the best- and the worst-performing demographics across models-up to x13 greater for protected attributes with larger performance discrepancies between segments.

Given a pair of main and reference images, this task attempts to answer several questions on both diseases and, more importantly, the differences between them. This is consistent with the radiologist's diagnosis practice that compares the current image with the reference before concluding the report. We collect a new dataset, namely MIMIC-Diff-VQA, including 700,703 QA pairs from 164,324 pairs of main and reference images. Compared to existing medical VQA datasets, our questions are tailored to the Assessment-Diagnosis-Intervention-Evaluation treatment procedure used by clinical professionals. Meanwhile, we also propose a novel expert knowledge-aware graph representation learning model to address this task. The proposed baseline model leverages expert knowledge such as anatomical structure prior, semantic, and spatial knowledge to construct a multi-relationship graph, representing the image differences between two images for the image difference VQA task. The dataset and code can be found at https://github.com/Holipori/MIMIC-Diff-VQA. We believe this work would further push forward the medical vision language model.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in data-driven approaches for recommending optimal treatment strategies in many chronic disease management and critical care applications. Reinforcement learning methods are well-suited to this sequential decision-making problem, but must be trained and evaluated exclusively on retrospective medical record datasets as direct online exploration is unsafe and infeasible. Despite this requirement, the vast majority of treatment optimization studies use off-policy RL methods (e.g., Double Deep Q Networks (DDQN) or its variants) that are known to perform poorly in purely offline settings. Recent advances in offline RL, such as Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), offer a suitable alternative. But there remain challenges in adapting these approaches to real-world applications where suboptimal examples dominate the retrospective dataset and strict safety constraints need to be satisfied. In this work, we introduce a practical and theoretically grounded transition sampling approach to address action imbalance during offline RL training. We perform extensive experiments on two real-world tasks for diabetes and sepsis treatment optimization to compare performance of the proposed approach against prominent off-policy and offline RL baselines (DDQN and CQL). Across a range of principled and clinically relevant metrics, we show that our proposed approach enables substantial improvements in expected health outcomes and in consistency with relevant practice and safety guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Burnout is a significant public health concern affecting nearly half of the healthcare workforce. This paper presents the first end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting physician burnout based on electronic health record (EHR) activity logs, digital traces of physician work activities that are available in any EHR system. In contrast to prior approaches that exclusively relied on surveys for burnout measurement, our framework directly learns deep representations of physician behaviors from large-scale clinician activity logs to predict burnout. We propose the Hierarchical burnout Prediction based on Activity Logs (HiPAL), featuring a pre-trained time-dependent activity embedding mechanism tailored for activity logs and a hierarchical predictive model, which mirrors the natural hierarchical structure of clinician activity logs and captures physicians' evolving burnout risk at both short-term and long-term levels. To utilize the large amount of unlabeled activity logs, we propose a semi-supervised framework that learns to transfer knowledge extracted from unlabeled clinician activities to the HiPAL-based prediction model. The experiment on over 15 million clinician activity logs collected from the EHR at a large academic medical center demonstrates the advantages of our proposed framework in predictive performance of physician burnout and training efficiency over state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Recurring outbreaks of COVID-19 have posed enduring effects on global society, which calls for a predictor of pandemic waves using various data with early availability. Existing prediction models that forecast the first outbreak wave using mobility data may not be applicable to the multiwave prediction, because the evidence in the USA and Japan has shown that mobility patterns across different waves exhibit varying relationships with fluctuations in infection cases. Therefore, to predict the multiwave pandemic, we propose a Social Awareness-Based Graph Neural Network (SAB-GNN) that considers the decay of symptom-related web search frequency to capture the changes in public awareness across multiple waves. Our model combines GNN and LSTM to model the complex relationships among urban districts, inter-district mobility patterns, web search history, and future COVID-19 infections. We train our model to predict future pandemic outbreaks in the Tokyo area using its mobility and web search data from April 2020 to May 2021 across four pandemic waves collected by Yahoo Japan Corporation under strict privacy protection rules. Results demonstrate our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as ST-GNN, MPNN, and GraphLSTM. Though our model is not computationally expensive (only 3 layers and 10 hidden neurons), the proposed model enables public agencies to anticipate and prepare for future pandemic outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is the leading cause of in-hospital mortality in the USA. Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Finally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction and active sensing based on our pre-trained models. Clinicians and potential sepsis patients can benefit from the system in early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning methods especially recurrent neural network based models have demonstrated early success in disease risk prediction on longitudinal patient data. Existing works follow a strong assumption to implicitly assume the stationary disease progression during each time period, and thus, take a homogeneous way to decay the information from previous time steps for all patients. However,in reality, disease progression is non-stationary. Besides, the key time steps for a target disease vary among patients. To leverage time information for risk prediction in a more reasonable way, we propose a new hierarchical time-aware attention network, named HiTANet, which imitates the decision making process of doctors inrisk prediction. Particularly, HiTANet models time information in local and global stages. The local evaluation stage has a time aware Transformer that embeds time information into visit-level embed-ding and generates local attention weight for each visit. The global synthesis stage further adopts a time-aware key-query attention mechanism to assign global weights to different time steps. Finally, the two types of attention weights are dynamically combined to generate the patient representations for further risk prediction. We evaluate HiTANet on three real-world datasets. Compared with the best results among twelve competing baselines, HiTANet achieves over 7% in terms of F1 score on all datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model and the necessity of modeling time information in risk prediction task.",

    "abstract": "Severe infectious diseases such as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pose a huge threat to public health. Stringent control measures, such as school closures and stay-at-home orders, while having significant effects, also bring huge economic losses. In the face of an emerging infectious disease, a crucial question for policymakers is how to make the trade-off and implement the appropriate interventions timely given the huge uncertainty. In this work, we propose a Multi-Objective Model-based Reinforcement Learning framework to facilitate data-driven decision-making and minimize the overall long-term cost. Specifically, at each decision point, a Bayesian epidemiological model is first learned as the environment model, and then the proposed model-based multi-objective planning algorithm is applied to find a set of Pareto-optimal policies. This framework, combined with the prediction bands for each policy, provides a real-time decision support tool for policymakers. The application is demonstrated with the spread of COVID-19 in China.",

To this end, prediction algorithms have been developed that estimate the risk of mortality in ICUs. In this work, we propose a novel generative deep probabilistic model for real-time risk scoring in ICUs. Specifically, we develop an attentive deep Markov model called AttDMM. To the best of our knowledge, AttDMM is the first ICU prediction model that jointly learns both long-term disease dynamics (via attention) and different disease states in health trajectory (via a latent variable model). Our evaluations were based on an established baseline dataset (MIMIC-III) with 53,423 ICU stays. The results confirm that compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our AttDMM was superior: AttDMM achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.876, which yielded an improvement over the state-of-the-art method by 2.2%. In addition, the risk score from the AttDMM provided warnings several hours earlier. Thereby, our model shows a path towards identifying patients at risk so that health practitioners can intervene early and save patient lives.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have achieved expert-level performance in healthcare with an exclusive focus on training accurate models. However, in many clinical environments such as intensive care unit (ICU), real-time model serving is equally if not more important than accuracy, because in ICU patient care is simultaneously more urgent and more expensive. Clinical decisions and their timeliness, therefore, directly affect both the patient outcome and the cost of care. To make timely decisions, we argue the underlying serving system must be latency-aware. To compound the challenge, health analytic applications often require a combination of models instead of a single model, to better specialize individual models for different targets, multi-modal data, different prediction windows, and potentially personalized predictions. To address these challenges, we propose HOLMES---an online model ensemble serving framework for healthcare applications. HOLMES dynamically identifies the best performing set of models to ensemble for highest accuracy, while also satisfying sub-second latency constraints on end-to-end prediction. We demonstrate that HOLMES is able to navigate the accuracy/latency tradeoff efficiently, compose the ensemble, and serve the model ensemble pipeline, scaling to simultaneously streaming data from 100 patients, each producing waveform data at 250~Hz. HOLMES outperforms the conventional offline batch-processed inference for the same clinical task in terms of accuracy and latency (by order of magnitude). HOLMES is tested on risk prediction task on pediatric cardio ICU data with above 95% prediction accuracy and sub-second latency on 64-bed simulation.",

    "abstract": "Learning individualized causal effect (ICE) plays a vital role in various fields of big data analysis, ranging from fine-grained policy evaluation to personalized treatment development. However, the presence of unmeasured confounders increases the difficulty of estimating ICE in real-world scenarios. A wide range of methods have been proposed to address the unmeasured confounders with the aid of instrument variable (IV), which sources from the treatment randomization. The performance of these methods relies on the well-predefined IVs that satisfy the unconfounded instruments assumption (i.e., the IVs are independent with the unmeasured confounders given observed covariates), which is untestable and leads to finding a valid IV becomes an art rather than science. In this paper, we focus on estimating the ICE with confounded instruments that violate the unconfounded instruments assumption. By considering the conditional independence between the set of confounded instruments and the outcome variable, we propose a novel method, named CVAE-IV, to generate a substitute of the unmeasured confounder with a conditional variational autoencoder. Our theoretical analysis guarantees that the generated confounder substitute will identify unbiased ICE. Extensive experiments on bias demand prediction and Mendelian randomization analysis verify the effectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Explanation supervision is a technique in which the model is guided by human-generated explanations during training. This technique aims to improve both the interpretability and predictability of the model by incorporating human understanding into the training process. Since explanation supervision requires a large scale of training data, the data augmentation technique is necessary to be applied to increase the size and diversity of the original dataset. However, data augmentation on sophisticated data like medical images is particularly challenging due to the following: 1) scarcity of data in training the learning-based data augmenter, 2) difficulty in generating realistic and sophisticated images, and 3) difficulty in ensuring the augmented data indeed boosts the performance of explanation-guided learning. To solve these challenges, we propose an Explanation Iterative Supervision via Saliency-guided Data Augmentation (ESSA) framework for conducting explanation supervision and adversarial-trained image data augmentation via a synergized iterative loop that handles the translation from annotation to sophisticated images and the generation of synthetic image-annotation pairs with an alternating training strategy. Extensive experiments on two datasets from the medical imaging domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in improving both the predictability and explainability of the model.",

    "abstract": "With the development of electronic health records (EHRs), prenatal care examination records have become available for developing automatic prediction or diagnosis approaches with machine learning methods. In this paper, we study how to effectively learn representations applied to various downstream tasks for EHR data. Although several methods have been proposed in this direction, they usually adapt classic sequential models to solve one specific diagnosis task or address unique EHR data issues. This makes it difficult to reuse these existing methods for the early diagnosis of pregnancy complications or provide a general solution to address the series of health problems caused by pregnancy complications. In this paper, we propose a novel model RAPT, which stands for RepresentAtion by Pre-training time-aware Transformer. To associate pre-training and EHR data, we design an architecture that is suitable for both modeling EHR data and pre-training, namely time-aware Transformer. To handle various characteristics in EHR data, such as insufficiency, we carefully devise three pre-training tasks to handle data insufficiency, data incompleteness and short sequence problems, namely similarity prediction, masked prediction and reasonability check. In this way, our representations can capture various EHR data characteristics. Extensive experimental results for four downstream tasks have shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We also introduce sensitivity analysis to interpret the model and design an interface to show results and interpretation for doctors. Finally, we implement a diagnosis system for pregnancy complications based on our pre-training model. Doctors and pregnant women can benefit from the diagnosis system in early diagnosis of pregnancy complications.",

However, due to their characteristics of high dimensionality and low sample size, directly applying deep learning models on biological networks usually faces severe overfitting. In this work, we propose R-MIXUP, a Mixup-based data augmentation technique that suits the symmetric positive definite (SPD) property of adjacency matrices from biological networks with optimized training efficiency. The interpolation process in R-MIXUP leverages the log-Euclidean distance metrics from the Riemannian manifold, effectively addressing the swelling effect and arbitrarily incorrect label issues of vanilla Mixup. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-MIXUP with five real-world biological network datasets on both regression and classification tasks. Besides, we derive a commonly ignored necessary condition for identifying the SPD matrices of biological networks and empirically study its influence on the model performance. The code implementation can be found in Appendix D.",

    "abstract": "Investigating relationships between response variables and covariates in areas such as environmental science, geoscience, and public health is an important endeavor. Based on a Bayesian mixture of finite mixtures model, we present a novel spatially clustered coefficients regression model for count value data. The proposed method detects the spatial homogeneity of the Poisson regression coefficients. A Markov random field constrained mixture of finite mixtures prior provides a regularized estimator of the number of clusters of regression coefficients with geographical neighborhood information. As a by-product, we also provide the theoretical properties of our proposed method when the Markov random field is exchangeable. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed by using the multivariate log gamma distribution as a base distribution. Simulation studies are carried out to examine the empirical performance of the proposed method. Additionally, we analyze Georgia's premature death data as an illustration of the effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "Real-world environments are inherently non-stationary, frequently introducing new classes over time. This is especially common in time series classification, such as the emergence of new disease classification in healthcare or the addition of new activities in human activity recognition. In such cases, a learning system is required to assimilate novel classes effectively while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the old ones, which gives rise to the Class-incremental Learning (CIL) problem. However, despite the encouraging progress in the image and language domains, CIL for time series data remains relatively understudied. Existing studies suffer from inconsistent experimental designs, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation and benchmarking of methods across a wide range of datasets. To this end, we first present an overview of the Time Series Class-incremental Learning (TSCIL) problem, highlight its unique challenges, and cover the advanced methodologies. Further, based on standardized settings, we develop a unified experimental framework that supports the rapid development of new algorithms, easy integration of new datasets, and standardization of the evaluation process. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various generic and time-series-specific CIL methods in both standard and privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our extensive experiments not only provide a standard baseline to support future research but also shed light on the impact of various design factors such as normalization layers or memory budget thresholds.

    "abstract": "Hypergraphs provide an effective abstraction for modeling multi-way group interactions among nodes, where each hyperedge can connect any number of nodes. Different from most existing studies which leverage statistical dependencies, we study hypergraphs from the perspective of causality. Specifically, in this paper, we focus on the problem of individual treatment effect (ITE) estimation on hypergraphs, aiming to estimate how much an intervention (e.g., wearing face covering) would causally affect an outcome (e.g., COVID-19 infection) of each individual node. Existing works on ITE estimation either assume that the outcome on one individual should not be influenced by the treatment assignments on other individuals (i.e., no interference), or assume the interference only exists between pairs of connected individuals in an ordinary graph. We argue that these assumptions can be unrealistic on real-world hypergraphs, where higher-order interference can affect the ultimate ITE estimations due to the presence of group interactions. In this work, we investigate high-order interference modeling, and propose a new causality learning framework powered by hypergraph neural networks. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs verify the superiority of our framework over existing baselines.",

This suggests that the study could potentially be applied to health and disease control scenarios, especially for estimating individual treatment effects (ITE) in healthcare-related interventions. The mention of causal effects in the context of infection outcomes implies relevance to Healthcare AI and possibly Biomedicine AI within the context of public health interventions. The exploration of high-order group interactions in hypergraphs could have direct implications for modeling infection dynamics or treatment effects in medical and healthcare settings.",

    "abstract": "To improve the accuracy of clinical multivariate time series (MTS) classification (such as EEG and ECG) by a novel self-supervised paradigm that directly captures the dynamics between the different time series learned together to optimize the classification task. Labels in clinical datasets are very often insufficient. One way to address this challenge is leveraging self-supervision. This paradigm attempts to identify a supervisory signal inherent within a dataset to serve as a surrogate label. We present a novel form of self-supervision: dynamics of clinical MTS. Unlike other self-supervision methods, such as masking, that are intuitive but still heuristic, we suggest to learn a representation justified by Koopman theory. The latter was shown useful for representing clinical time series and can be used as a form of surrogate task to improve the clinical MTS classification. In the ECG task, we show that our proposed framework achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline over numerous common diagnoses. For EEG abnormality classification, our proposed framework also achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than the SOTA baseline. All results are statistically significant. Our technique yields reliable clinical diagnosis in an empirical study employing signals from thousands of patients in multiple clinical tasks employing two types of clinical-grade sensors (ECG and EEG) as compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning. Leveraging time-series-dynamics self-supervision can help mitigate the lack of labels in clinical datasets used for training machine learning algorithms and significantly improve their performance. Specifically, the ECG system presented in this work is being trialed in hospitals, used by top cardiologists for patient diagnosis and treatment. We believe that the deployment of such cutting-edge technology will significantly improve the accuracy and speed of cardiac assessments.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic simulations such as large-scale, spatiotemporal, age-structured epidemic models are computationally expensive at fine-grained resolution. While deep surrogate models can speed up the simulations, doing so for stochastic simulations and with active learning approaches is an underexplored area. We propose Interactive Neural Process (INP), a deep Bayesian active learning framework for learning deep surrogate models to accelerate stochastic simulations. INP consists of two components, a spatiotemporal surrogate model built upon Neural Process (NP) family and an acquisition function for active learning. For surrogate modeling, we develop Spatiotemporal Neural Process (STNP) to mimic the simulator dynamics. For active learning, we propose a novel acquisition function, Latent Information Gain (LIG), calculated in the latent space of NP based models. We perform a theoretical analysis and demonstrate that LIG reduces sample complexity compared with random sampling in high dimensions. We also conduct empirical studies on three complex spatiotemporal simulators for reaction diffusion, heat flow, and infectious disease. The results demonstrate that STNP outperforms the baselines in the offline learning setting and LIG achieves the state-of-the-art for Bayesian active learning.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes prediction is an important data science application in the social healthcare domain. There exist two main challenges in the diabetes prediction task: data heterogeneity since demographic and metabolic data are of different types, data insufficiency since the number of diabetes cases in a single medical center is usually limited. To tackle the above challenges, we employ gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) to handle data heterogeneity and introduce multi-task learning (MTL) to solve data insufficiency. To this end, Task-wise Split Gradient Boosting Trees (TSGB) is proposed for the multi-center diabetes prediction task. Specifically, we firstly introduce task gain to evaluate each task separately during tree construction, with a theoretical analysis of GBDT's learning objective. Secondly, we reveal a problem when directly applying GBDT in MTL, i.e., the negative task gain problem. Finally, we propose a novel split method for GBDT in MTL based on the task gain statistics, named task-wise split, as an alternative to standard feature-wise split to overcome the mentioned negative task gain problem. Extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world diabetes dataset and a commonly used benchmark dataset demonstrate TSGB achieves superior performance against several state-of-the-art methods. Detailed case studies further support our analysis of negative task gain problems and provide insightful findings. The proposed TSGB method has been deployed as an online diabetes risk assessment software for early diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "The usage of smartphone-collected respiratory sound, trained with deep learning models, for detecting and classifying COVID-19 becomes popular recently. It removes the need for in-person testing procedures especially for rural regions where related medical supplies, experienced workers, and equipment are limited. However, existing sound-based diagnostic approaches are trained in a fully-supervised manner, which requires large scale well-labelled data. It is critical to discover new methods to leverage unlabelled respiratory data, which can be obtained more easily. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning enabled framework for COVID-19 cough classification. A contrastive pre-training phase is introduced to train a Transformer-based feature encoder with unlabelled data. Specifically, we design a random masking mechanism to learn robust representations of respiratory sounds. The pre-trained feature encoder is then fine-tuned in the downstream phase to perform cough classification. In addition, different ensembles with varied random masking rates are also explored in the downstream phase. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed contrastive pre-training, the random masking mechanism, and the ensemble architecture contribute to improving cough classification performance.",

    "abstract": "Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in medical applications is helping our world to deal with the shortage of healthcare workers and improve the efficiency and productivity of healthcare delivery. Intelligent pre-consultation (IPC) is a relatively new application deployed on mobile terminals for collecting patient's information before a face-to-face consultation. It takes advantages of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to assist doctors on clinical decision-making. One of key functions of IPC is to detect medical symptoms from patient queries. By extracting symptoms from patient queries, IPC is able to collect more information on patient's health status by asking symptom-related questions. All collected information will be summarized as a medical record for doctors to make clinical decision. This saves a great deal of time for both doctors and patients. Detecting symptoms from patient's query is challenging, as most patients lack medical background and often tend to use colloquial language to describe their symptoms. In this work, we formulate symptom detection as a retrieval problem and propose a bi-directional hard-negative enforced noise contrastive estimation method (Bi-hardNCE) to tackle the symptom detection problem. Bi-hardNCE has both forward contrastive estimation and backward contrastive estimation, which forces model to distinguish the true symptom from negative symptoms and meanwhile distinguish true query from negative queries. To include more informative negatives, our Bi-hardNCE adopts a hard-negative mining strategy and a false-negative eliminating strategy, which achieved a significant improvement on performance. Our proposed model outperforms commonly used retrieval models by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "Given the risks and cost of hospitalization, there has been significant interest in exploiting machine learning models to improve perioperative care. However, due to the high dimensionality and noisiness of perioperative data, it remains a challenge to develop accurate and robust encoding for surgical predictions. Furthermore, it is important for the encoding to be interpretable by perioperative care practitioners to facilitate their decision making process. We proposeclinical variational autoencoder (cVAE), a deep latent variable model that addresses the challenges of surgical applications through two salient features. (1) To overcome performance limitations of traditional VAE, it isprediction-guided with explicit expression of predicted outcome in the latent representation. (2) Itdisentangles the latent space so that it can be interpreted in a clinically meaningful fashion. We apply cVAE to two real-world perioperative datasets to evaluate its efficacy and performance in predicting outcomes that are important to perioperative care, including postoperative complication and surgery duration. To demonstrate the generality and facilitate reproducibility, we also apply cVAE to the open MIMIC-III dataset for predicting ICU duration and mortality. Our results show that the latent representation provided by cVAE leads to superior performance in classification, regression and multi-task predictions. The two features of cVAE are mutually beneficial and eliminate the need of a predictor. We further demonstrate the interpretability of the disentangled representation and its capability to capture intrinsic characteristics of hospitalized patients. While this work is motivated by and evaluated in the context of clinical applications, the proposed approach may be generalized for other fields using high-dimensional and noisy data and valuing interpretable representations.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing interests to improve clinical efficiency, owing to their unprecedented performance in modelling natural language. Ensuring the reliable clinical applications, the evaluation of LLMs indeed becomes critical for better mitigating the potential risks,e.g., hallucinations. However, current evaluation methods heavily rely on labor-intensive human participation to achieve human-preferred judgements. To overcome this challenge, we propose an automatic evaluation paradigm tailored to assess the LLMs' capabilities in delivering clinical services,e.g., disease diagnosis and treatment. The evaluation paradigm contains three basic elements: metric, data, and algorithm. Specifically, inspired by professional clinical practice pathways, we formulate a LLM-specific clinical pathway (LCP) to define the clinical capabilities that a doctor agent should possess. Then, Standardized Patients (SPs) from the medical education are introduced as the guideline for collecting medical data for evaluation, which can well ensure the completeness of the evaluation procedure. Leveraging these steps, we develop a multi-agent framework to simulate the interactive environment between SPs and a doctor agent, which is equipped with a Retrieval-Augmented Evaluation (RAE) to determine whether the behaviors of a doctor agent are in accordance with LCP. The above paradigm can be extended to any similar clinical scenarios to automatically evaluate the LLMs' medical capabilities. Applying such paradigm, we construct an evaluation benchmark in the field of urology, including a LCP, a SPs dataset, and an automated RAE. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing more insights for LLMs' safe and reliable deployments in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the task of ranking individuals based on the potential benefit of being \"treated\" (e.g. by a drug or exposure to recommendations or ads), referred to as Uplift Modeling in the literature. This application has gained a surge of interest in recent years and it is found in many applications such as personalized medicine, recommender systems or targeted advertising. In real life scenarios the capacity of models to rank individuals by potential benefit is measured by the Area Under the Uplift Curve (AUUC), a ranking metric related to the well known Area Under ROC Curve. In the case where the objective function, for learning model parameters, is different from AUUC, the capacity of the resulting system to generalize on AUUC is limited. To tackle this issue, we propose to learn a model that directly optimizes an upper bound on AUUC. To find such a model we first develop a generalization bound on AUUC and then derive from it a learning objective called AUUC-max, usable with linear and deep models. We empirically study the tightness of this generalization bound, its effectiveness for hyperparameters tuning and show the efficiency of the proposed learning objective compared to a wide range of competitive baselines on two classical uplift modeling benchmarks using real-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "Sequences of events including infectious disease outbreaks, social network activities, and crimes are ubiquitous and the data on such events carry essential information about the underlying diffusion processes between communities (e.g., regions, online user groups). Modeling diffusion processes and predicting future events are crucial in many applications including epidemic control, viral marketing, and predictive policing. Hawkes processes offer a central tool for modeling the diffusion processes, in which the influence from the past events is described by the triggering kernel. However, the triggering kernel parameters, which govern how each community is influenced by the past events, are assumed to be static over time. In the real world, the diffusion processes depend not only on the influences from the past, but also the current (time-evolving) states of the communities, e.g., people's awareness of the disease and people's current interests. In this paper, we propose a novel Hawkes process model that is able to capture the underlying dynamics of community states behind the diffusion processes and predict the occurrences of events based on the dynamics. Specifically, we model the latent dynamic function that encodes these hidden dynamics by a mixture of neural networks. Then we design the triggering kernel using the latent dynamic function and its integral. The proposed method, termed DHP (Dynamic Hawkes Processes), offers a flexible way to learn complex representations of the time-evolving communities' states, while at the same time it allows to computing the exact likelihood, which makes parameter learning tractable. Extensive experiments on four real-world event datasets show that DHP outperforms five widely adopted methods for event prediction.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive patient health history is essential for patient care and healthcare research. However, due to the distributed nature of healthcare services, patient health records are often scattered across multiple systems. Existing record linkage approaches primarily rely on patient identifiers, which have inherent limitations such as privacy invasion and identifier discrepancies. To tackle this problem, we propose linking de-identified patient health records by matching health patterns without strictly relying on sensitive patient identifiers. Our model MedLink solves two challenges faced with the patient linkage task: (1) the challenge of identifying the same patients based on data collected in different timelines as disease progression makes the record matching difficult, and (2) the challenge of identifying distinct health patterns as common medical codes dominate health records and overshadow the more informative low-prevalence codes. To address these challenges, MedLink utilizes bi-directional health prediction to predict future codes forwardly and past codes backwardly, thus accounting for the health progression. MedLink also has a prevalence-aware retrieval design to focus more on the low-prevalence but informative codes during learning. MedLink can be trained end-to-end and is lightweight for efficient inference on large patient databases. We evaluate MedLink against leading baselines on real-world patient datasets, including the critical care dataset MIMIC-III and a large health claims dataset. Results show that MedLink outperforms the best baseline by 4% in top-1 accuracy with only 8% memory cost. Additionally, when combined with existing identifier-based linkage approaches, MedLink can improve their performance by up to 15%.",

    "abstract": "Explanation supervision aims to enhance deep learning models by integrating additional signals to guide the generation of model explanations, showcasing notable improvements in both the predictability and explainability of the model. However, the application of explanation supervision to higher-dimensional data, such as 3D medical images, remains an under-explored domain. Challenges associated with supervising visual explanations in the presence of an additional dimension include: 1) spatial correlation changed, 2) lack of direct 3D annotations, and 3) uncertainty varies across different parts of the explanation. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Uncertainty-aware Explanation supervision (DUE\\footnoteCode available at: https://github.com/AlexQilong/DUE.) framework for 3D explanation supervision that ensures uncertainty-aware explanation guidance when dealing with sparsely annotated 3D data with diffusion-based 3D interpolation. Our proposed framework is validated through comprehensive experiments on diverse real-world medical imaging datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing the predictability and explainability of deep learning models in the context of medical imaging diagnosis applications.",

    "abstract": "Early multi-label classification of time series, the assignment of a label set to a time series before the series is entirely observed, is critical for time-sensitive domains such as healthcare. In such cases, waiting too long to classify can render predictions useless, regardless of their accuracy, while predicting prematurely can result in potentially costly erroneous results. When predicting multiple labels (for example, types of infections), dependencies between labels can be learned and leveraged to improve overall accuracy. Together, reliably predicting the correct label set of a time series while observing as few timesteps as possible is challenging because these goals are contradictory in that fewer timesteps often means worse accuracy. To achieve early yet sufficiently accurate predictions, correlations between labels must be accounted for since direct evidence of some labels may only appear late in the series. We design an effective solution to this open problem, the Recurrent Halting Chain (RHC), that for the first time integrates key innovations in both Early and Multi-label Classification into one multi-objective model. RHC uses a recurrent neural network to jointly model raw time series as well as correlations between labels, resulting in a novel order-free classifier chain that tackles this time-sensitive multi-label learning task. Further, RHC employs a reinforcement learning-based halting network to decide at each timestep which, if any, classes should be predicted, learning to build the label set over time. Using two real-world time-sensitive datasets and popular multi-label metrics, we show that RHC outperforms recent alternatives by predicting more-accurate label sets earlier.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent dynamical systems refer to scenarios where multiple units (aka agents) interact with each other and evolve collectively over time. For instance, people's health conditions are mutually influenced. Receiving vaccinations not only strengthens the long-term health status of one unit but also provides protection for those in their immediate surroundings. To make informed decisions in multi-agent dynamical systems, such as determining the optimal vaccine distribution plan, it is essential for decision-makers to estimate the continuous-time counterfactual outcomes. However, existing studies of causal inference over time rely on the assumption that units are mutually independent, which is not valid for multi-agent dynamical systems. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap and study how to estimate counterfactual outcomes in multi-agent dynamical systems. Causal inference in a multi-agent dynamical system has unique challenges: 1) Confounders are time-varying and are present in both individual unit covariates and those of other units; 2) Units are affected by not only their own but also others' treatments; 3) The treatments are naturally dynamic, such as receiving vaccines and boosters in a seasonal manner. To this end, we model a multi-agent dynamical system as a graph and propose a novel model called CF-GODE (C ounterFactual Graph Ordinary Differential Equations). CF-GODE is a causal model that estimates continuous-time counterfactual outcomes in the presence of inter-dependencies between units. To facilitate continuous-time estimation, we propose Treatment-Induced GraphODE, a novel ordinary differential equation based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which can incorporate dynamical treatments as additional inputs to predict potential outcomes over time. To remove confounding bias, we propose two domain adversarial learning based objectives that learn balanced continuous representation trajectories, which are not predictive of treatments and interference. We further provide theoretical justification to prove their effectiveness. Experiments on two semi-synthetic datasets confirm that CF-GODE outperforms baselines on counterfactual estimation. We also provide extensive analyses to understand how our model works.",

    "abstract": "In several medical decision-making problems, such as antibiotic prescription, laboratory testing can provide precise indications for how a patient will respond to different treatment options. This enables us to \"fully observe\" all potential treatment outcomes, but while present in historical data, these results are infeasible to produce in real-time at the point of the initial treatment decision. Moreover, treatment policies in these settings often need to trade off between multiple competing objectives, such as effectiveness of treatment and harmful side effects. We present, compare, and evaluate three approaches for learning individualized treatment policies in this setting: First, we consider two indirect approaches, which use predictive models of treatment response to construct policies optimal for different trade-offs between objectives. Second, we consider a direct approach that constructs such a set of policies without intermediate models of outcomes. Using a medical dataset of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) patients, we show that all approaches learn policies that achieve strictly better performance on all outcomes than clinicians, while also trading off between different objectives. We demonstrate additional benefits of the direct approach, including flexibly incorporating other goals such as deferral to physicians on simple cases.",

Although impressive results have been achieved, we find that existing benchmarks do not reflect the complexity of real medical reports and specialized in-depth reasoning capabilities. In this work, we establish a comprehensive benchmark in the field of medical specialization and introduced RJUA-MedDQA, which contains 2000 real-world Chinese medical report images poses several challenges: comprehensively interpreting imgage content across a wide variety of challenging layouts, possessing the numerical reasoning ability to identify abnormal indicators and demonstrating robust clinical reasoning ability to provide the statement of disease diagnosis, status and advice based on a collection of medical contexts. We carefully design the data generation pipeline and proposed the Efficient Structural Restoration Annotation (ESRA) Method, aimed at restoring textual and tabular content in medical report images. This method substantially enhances annotation efficiency, doubling the productivity of each annotator, and yields a 26.8% improvement in accuracy. We conduct extensive evaluations, including few-shot assessments of 5 LMMs which are capable of solving Chinese medical QA tasks. To further investigate the limitations and potential of current LMMs, we conduct comparative experiments on a set of strong LLMs by using image-text generated by ESRA method. We report the performance of baselines and offer several observations: (1) The overall performance of existing LMMs is still limited; however LMMs more robust to low-quality and diverse-structured images compared to LLMs. (3) Reasoning across context and image content present significant challenges. We hope this benchmark helps the community make progress on these challenging tasks in multi-modal medical document understanding and facilitate its application in healthcare.

This is accomplished by learning a latent space from available data and using a surrogate modelfΦto guide optimization algorithms toward optimal outputs. However, existing methods struggle when labeled data is limited, as trainingfΦwith few labeled data points can lead to subpar outputs, offering no advantage over the training data itself. We address this challenge by introducingGROOT,aGRaph-based Latent SmOOThing for Biological Sequence Optimization. In particular, GROOT generates pseudo-labels for neighbors sampled around the training latent embeddings. These pseudo-labels are then refined and smoothed by Label Propagation. Additionally, we theoretically and empirically justify our approach, demonstrate GROOT's ability to extrapolate to regions beyond the training set while maintaining reliability within an upper bound of their expected distances from the training regions. We evaluate GROOT on various biological sequence design tasks, including protein optimization (GFP and AAV) and three tasks with exact oracles from Design-Bench. The results demonstrate that GROOT equalizes and surpasses existing methods without requiring access to black-box oracles or vast amounts of labeled data, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness.

Most existing drug repurposing studies using real-world patient data often treat the entire population as homogeneous, ignoring the heterogeneity of treatment responses across patient subgroups. This approach may overlook promising drugs that benefit specific subgroups but lack notable treatment effects across the entire population, potentially limiting the number of repurposable candidates identified. To address this, we introduceSTEDR, a novel drug repurposing framework that integrates subgroup analysis with treatment effect estimation. Our approach first identifies repurposing candidates by emulating multiple clinical trials on real-world patient data and then characterizes patient subgroups by learning subgroup-specific treatment effects. We deploySTEDRto Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a condition with few approved drugs and known heterogeneity in treatment responses. We emulate trials for over one thousand medications on a large-scale real-world database covering over 8 million patients, identifying 14 drug candidates with beneficial effects to AD in characterized subgroups. Experiments demonstrateSTEDRsuperior capability in identifying repurposing candidates compared to existing approaches. Additionally, our method can characterize clinically relevant patient subgroups associated with important AD-related risk factors, paving the way for precision drug repurposing.",

    "abstract": "Sleep stage classification has important clinical significance for the diagnosis of sleep-related diseases. To pursue more accurate sleep stage classification, multi-channel sleep signals are widely used due to the rich spatial-temporal information contained. However, it leads to a great increment in the size and computational costs, which constrain the application of multi-channel sleep models on hardware devices. Knowledge distillation is an effective way to compress models, yet existing knowledge distillation methods cannot fully extract and transfer the spatial-temporal knowledge in the multi-channel sleep signals. To solve the problem, we propose a general knowledge distillation framework for multi-channel sleep stage classification called spatial-temporal mutual distillation. Based on the spatial relationship of human body and the temporal transition rules of sleep signals, the spatial and temporal modules are designed to extract the spatial-temporal knowledge, thus help the lightweight student model learn the rich spatial-temporal knowledge from large-scale teacher model. The mutual distillation framework transfers the spatial-temporal knowledge mutually. Teacher model and student model can learn from each other, further improving the student model. The results on the ISRUC-III and MASS-SS3 datasets show that our proposed framework compresses the sleep models effectively with minimal performance loss and achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared to the baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, therapeutic antibodies have become one of the fastest-growing classes of drugs and have been approved for the treatment of a wide range of indications, from cancer to autoimmune diseases. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are part of the variable chains in antibodies and determine specific antibody-antigen binding. Some explorations use in silicon methods to design antibody CDR loops. However, the existing methods faced the challenges of maintaining the specific geometry shape of the CDR loops. This paper proposes a Constrained Energy Model (CEM) to address this issue. Specifically, we design a constrained manifold to characterize the geometry constraints of the CDR loops. Then we design the energy model in the constrained manifold and only depict the energy landscape of the manifold instead of the whole space in the vanilla energy model. The geometry shape of the generated CDR loops is automatically preserved. Theoretical analysis shows that learning on the constrained manifold requires less sample complexity than the unconstrained method. CEM's superiority is validated via thorough empirical studies, achieving consistent and significant improvement with up to 33.4% relative reduction in terms of 3D geometry error (Root Mean Square Deviation, RMSD) and 8.4% relative reduction in terms of amino acid sequence metric (perplexity) compared to the best baseline method.

    "abstract": "Deep graph prompt tuning (DeepGPT), which only tunes a set of continuous prompts for graph transformers, significantly decreases the storage usage during training. However, DeepGPT is limited by its uniform prompts to input graphs with various structures. This is because different graph structures dictate various feature interactions between nodes, while the uniform prompts are not dynamic to tailor the feature transformation for the graph topology. In this paper, we propose a <u>T</u>opo-specific <u>G</u>raph <u>P</u>rompt <u>T</u>uning (TGPT ), which provides topo-specific prompts tailored to the topological structures of input graphs. Specifically, TGPT learns trainable embeddings for graphlets and frequencies, where graphlets are fundamental sub-graphs that describe the structure around specific nodes. Based on the statistic data about graphlets of input graph, topo-specific prompts are generated by graphlet embeddings and frequency embeddings. The topo-specific prompts include node-level topo-specific prompts for specified nodes, a graph-level topo-specific prompt for the entire graph, and a task-specific prompt to learn task-related information. They are all inserted into specific graph nodes to perform feature transformation, providing specified feature transformation for input graphs with different topological structures. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing lightweight fine-tuning methods and DeepGPT in molecular graph classification and regression with comparable parameters.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies are proteins that effectively protect the human body by binding to pathogens. Recently, deep learning-based computational antibody design has attracted popular attention since it automatically mines the antibody patterns from data that could be complementary to human experiences. However, the computational methods heavily rely on high-quality antibody structure data, which is quite limited. Besides, the complementarity-determining region (CDR), which is the key component of an antibody that determines the specificity and binding affinity, is highly variable and hard to predict. Therefore, the limited availability of high-quality antibody structure data exacerbates the difficulty of CDR generation. Fortunately, there is a large amount of sequence data for antibodies that can help model the CDR and reduce reliance on structure data. By witnessing the success of pre-training models for protein modeling, in this paper, we develop the antibody pre-training language model and incorporate it into the antigen-specific antibody design model in a systemic way. Specifically, we first pre-train a novel antibody language model based on the sequence data, then propose a one-shot way for sequence and structure generation of CDR to mitigate the high cost and error propagation associated with autoregressive methods, and finally leverage the pre-trained antibody model for the antigen-specific antibody generation model with some carefully designed modules. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous baselines in tasks such as sequence and structure generation, CDR-H3 design for antigen binding, and antibody optimization1.

    "abstract": "Information overload is a prevalent challenge in many high-value domains. A prominent case in point is the explosion of the biomedical literature on COVID-19, which swelled to hundreds of thousands of papers in a matter of months. In general, biomedical literature expands by two papers every minute, totalling over a million new papers every year. Search in the biomedical realm, and many other vertical domains is challenging due to the scarcity of direct supervision from click logs. Self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising direction to overcome the annotation bottleneck. We propose a general approach for vertical search based on domain-specific pretraining and present a case study for the biomedical domain. Despite being substantially simpler and not using any relevance labels for training or development, our method performs comparably or better than the best systems in the official TREC-COVID evaluation, a COVID-related biomedical search competition. Using distributed computing in modern cloud infrastructure, our system can scale to tens of millions of articles on PubMed and has been deployed as Microsoft Biomedical Search, a new search experience for biomedical literature: https://aka.ms/biomedsearch.",

    "abstract": "Online medical consultation, which enables patients to remotely inquire doctors in the form of web chatting, has become an indispensable part of the social health care system. Intuitively, it is a crucial step to recommend suitable doctor candidates for patients, especially with suffering the severe cold-start challenge of patients due to the limited historical records and insufficient description of patient condition. Along this line, in this paper, we propose a novel Dialogue based Doctor Recommendation (DDR) model, which comprehensively integrates three types of information in modeling, including the profile and chief complaint from patients, the historical records of doctors and the patient-doctor dialogue. Accordingly, we propose 1) a patient encoder which represents the patient's condition and medical requirements; 2) a doctor encoder which distills the doctor's expertise and communication skills; 3) a dialogue encoder which extracts textual features from doctor-patient conversation. Specifically, since the patient-doctor dialogue is not available in the testing stage, we propose to simulate the dialogue embedding with patient embedding via a contrastive learning based module. Experimental results on a real-world data set show that the proposed DDR model can outperform state-of-the-art recommendation-based methods. Moreover, considering the accessibility variance of online medical consultation services between the youth and the elderly, we also conduct a fairness study on the proposed DDR model.",

    "abstract": "Mobility restrictions have been a primary intervention for controlling the spread of COVID-19, but they also place a significant economic burden on individuals and businesses. To balance these competing demands, policymakers need analytical tools to assess the costs and benefits of different mobility reduction measures. In this paper, we present our work motivated by our interactions with the Virginia Department of Health on a decision-support tool that utilizes large-scale data and epidemiological modeling to quantify the impact of changes in mobility on infection rates. Our model captures the spread of COVID-19 by using a fine-grained, dynamic mobility network that encodes the hourly movements of people from neighborhoods to individual places, with over 3 billion hourly edges. By perturbing the mobility network, we can simulate a wide variety of reopening plans and forecast their impact in terms of new infections and the loss in visits per sector. To deploy this model in practice, we built a robust computational infrastructure to support running millions of model realizations, and we worked with policymakers to develop an interactive dashboard that communicates our model's predictions for thousands of potential policies.",

    "abstract": "Many real-world systems such as social networks and moving planets are dynamic in nature, where a set of coupled objects are connected via the interaction graph and exhibit complex behavior along the time. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic can be considered as a dynamical system, where objects represent geographical locations (e.g., states) whose daily confirmed cases of infection evolve over time. Outbreak at one location may influence another location as people travel between these locations, forming a graph. Thus, how to model and predict the complex dynamics for these systems becomes a critical research problem. Existing work on modeling graph-structured data mostly assumes a static setting. How to handle dynamic graphs remains to be further explored. On one hand, features of objects change over time, influenced by the linked objects in the interaction graph. On the other hand, the graph itself can also evolve, where new interactions (links) may form and existing links may drop, which may in turn be affected by the dynamic features of objects. In this paper, we propose coupled graph ODE: a novel latent ordinary differential equation (ODE) generative model that learns the coupled dynamics of nodes and edges with a graph neural network (GNN) based ODE in a continuous manner. Our model consists of two coupled ODE functions for modeling the dynamics of edges and nodes based on their latent representations respectively. It employs a novel encoder parameterized by a GNN for inferring the initial states from historical data, which serves as the starting point of the predicted latent trajectories. Experiment results on the COVID-19 dataset and the simulated social network dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Designing accurate deep learning models for molecular property prediction plays an increasingly essential role in drug and material discovery. Recently, due to the scarcity of labeled molecules, self-supervised learning methods for learning generalizable and transferable representations of molecular graphs have attracted lots of attention. In this paper, we argue that there exist two major issues hindering current self-supervised learning methods from obtaining desired performance on molecular property prediction, that is, the ill-defined pre-training tasks and the limited model capacity. To this end, we introduce Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KPGT), a novel self-supervised learning framework for molecular graph representation learning, to alleviate the aforementioned issues and improve the performance on the downstream molecular property prediction tasks. More specifically, we first introduce a high-capacity model, named Line Graph Transformer (LiGhT), which emphasizes the importance of chemical bonds and is mainly designed to model the structural information of molecular graphs. Then, a knowledge-guided pre-training strategy is proposed to exploit the additional knowledge of molecules to guide the model to capture the abundant structural and semantic information from large-scale unlabeled molecular graphs. Extensive computational tests demonstrated that KPGT can offer superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods on several molecular property prediction tasks.",

    "abstract": "Given that persons with a prior history of respiratory diseases tend to demonstrate more severe illness from COVID-19 and, hence, are at higher risk of serious symptoms, ambient air quality data from NASA's satellite observations might provide a critical insight into which geographical areas may exhibit higher numbers of hospitalizations due to COVID-19, how the expected severity of COVID-19 and associated survival rates may vary across space in the future, and most importantly how given this information, health professionals can distribute vaccines in a more efficient, timely, and fair manner. Despite the utmost urgency of this problem, there yet exists no systematic analysis on linkages among COVID-19 clinical severity, air quality, and other atmospheric conditions, beyond relatively simplistic regression-based models. The goal of this project is to glean a deeper insight into sophisticated spatio-temporal dependencies among air quality, atmospheric conditions, and COVID-19 clinical severity using the machinery of Geometric Deep Learning (GDL), while providing quantitative uncertainty estimates. Our results based on the GDL model on a county level in three US states, California, Pennsylvania and Texas, indicate that AOD attributes to COVID-19 clinical severity in 39, 30, and 132 counties out of 58, 67, and 254 total counties, respectively. In turn, relative humidity is another important factor for understanding dynamics of clinical course and mortality risks due COVID-19, but predictive utility of temperature is noticeably lower. Our findings do not only contribute to understanding of latent factors behind COVID-19 progression but open new perspectives for innovative use of NASA's datasets for biosurveillance and social good.",

    "abstract": "Gene sequence search is a fundamental operation in computational genomics with broad applications in medicine, evolutionary biology, metagenomics, and more. Due to the petabyte scale of genome archives, most gene search systems now use hashing-based data structures such asBloom Filters(BF). The state-of-the-art systems such asCompact bit-slicing signature index(COBS) andRepeated And Merged Bloom filters(RAMBO) use BF with Random Hash (RH) functions for gene representation and identification. The standard recipe is to cast the gene search problem as a sequence of membership problems testing if each subsequent gene substring (called kmer) of Q is present in the set of kmers of the entire gene database D. We observe that RH functions, which are crucial to the memory and the computational advantage of BF, are also detrimental to the system performance of gene-search systems. While subsequent kmers being queried are likely very similar, RH, oblivious to any similarity, uniformly distributes the kmers to different parts of potentially large BF, thus triggering excessive cache misses and causing system slowdown. We propose a novel hash function called the Identity with Locality (IDL) hash family, which co-locates the keys close in input space without causing collisions. This approach ensures both cache locality and key preservation. IDL functions can be a drop-in replacement for RH functions and help improve the performance of information retrieval systems. We give a simple but practical construction of IDL function families and show that replacing the RH with IDL functions reduces cache misses by a factor of 5x, thus improving query and indexing times of SOTA methods such as COBS and RAMBO by factors up to 2x without compromising their quality. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the false positive rate of BF with IDL functions. Our hash function is the first study that bridgesLocality Sensitive Hash(LSH) and RH to obtain cache efficiency. Our design and analysis could be of independent theoretical interest.",

However, SOTA Whittle-index-based approaches to this planning problem either do not consider fairness among arms, or incentivize fairness without guaranteeing it. We thus introduce ProbFair, a probabilistically fair policy that maximizes total expected reward and satisfies the budget constraint while ensuring a strictly positive lower bound on the probability of being pulled at each timestep. We evaluate our algorithm on a real-world application, where interventions support continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy adherence among patients, as well as on a broader class of synthetic transition matrices. We find that ProbFair preserves utility while providing fairness guarantees.",

    "abstract": "Molecular docking is a pivotal process in drug discovery. While traditional techniques rely on extensive sampling and simulation governed by physical principles, deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative, offering improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. Building upon the foundational work of FABind, a model focused on speed and accuracy, we introduce FABind+, an enhanced iteration that significantly elevates the performance of its predecessor. We identify pocket prediction as a critical bottleneck in molecular docking and introduce an enhanced approach. In addition to the pocket prediction module, the docking module has also been upgraded with permutation loss and a more refined model design. These designs enable the regression-based FABind+ to surpass most of the generative models. In contrast, while sampling-based models often struggle with inefficiency, they excel in capturing a wide range of potential docking poses, leading to better overall performance. To bridge the gap between sampling and regression docking models, we incorporate a simple yet effective sampling technique coupled with a lightweight confidence model, transforming the regression-based FABind+ into a sampling version without requiring additional training. This involves the introduction of pocket clustering to capture multiple binding sites and dropout sampling for various conformations. The combination of a classification loss and a ranking loss enables the lightweight confidence model to select the most accurate prediction. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that FABind+ (both the regression and sampling versions) not only significantly outperforms the original FABind, but also achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Large quantities of social activity data, such as weekly web search volumes and the number of new infections with infectious diseases, reflect peoples' interests and activities. It is important to discover temporal patterns from such data and to forecast future activities accurately. However, modeling and forecasting social activity data streams is difficult because they are high-dimensional and composed of multiple time-varying dynamics such as trends, seasonality, and interest diffusion. In this paper, we propose D-Tracker, a method for continuously capturing time-varying temporal patterns within social activity tensor data streams and forecasting future activities. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a)Interpretable: it incorporates the partial differential equation into a tensor decomposition framework and captures time-varying temporal patterns such as trends, seasonality, and interest diffusion between locations in an interpretable manner; (b)Automatic:it has no hyperparameters and continuously models tensor data streams fully automatically; (c)Scalable:the computation time of D-Trackeris independent of the time series length. Experiments using web search volume data obtained from GoogleTrends, and COVID-19 infection data obtained from COVID-19 Open Data Repository show that our method can achieve higher forecasting accuracy in less computation time than existing methods while extracting the interest diffusion between locations.

    "abstract": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an essential life-supporting modality for COVID-19 patients who are refractory to conventional therapies. However, the proper treatment decision has been the subject of significant debate and it remains controversial about who benefits from this scarcely available and technically complex treatment option. To support clinical decisions, it is a critical need to predict the treatment need and the potential treatment and no-treatment responses. Targeting this clinical challenge, we propose Treatment Variational AutoEncoder (TVAE), a novel approach for individualized treatment analysis. TVAE is specifically designed to address the modeling challenges like ECMO with strong treatment selection bias and scarce treatment cases. TVAE conceptualizes the treatment decision as a multi-scale problem. We model a patient's potential treatment assignment and the factual and counterfactual outcomes as part of their intrinsic characteristics that can be represented by a deep latent variable model. The factual and counterfactual prediction errors are alleviated via a reconstruction regularization scheme together with semi-supervision, and the selection bias and the scarcity of treatment cases are mitigated by the disentangled and distribution-matched latent space and the label-balancing generative strategy. We evaluate TVAE on two real-world COVID-19 datasets: an international dataset collected from 1651 hospitals across 63 countries, and a institutional dataset collected from 15 hospitals. The results show that TVAE outperforms state-of-the-art treatment effect models in predicting both the propensity scores and factual outcomes on heterogeneous COVID-19 datasets. Additional experiments also show TVAE outperforms the best existing models in individual treatment effect estimation on the synthesized IHDP benchmark dataset.",

    "abstract": "Molecular representation learning has attracted much attention recently. A molecule can be viewed as a 2D graph with nodes/atoms connected by edges/bonds, and can also be represented by a 3D conformation with 3-dimensional coordinates of all atoms. We note that most previous work handles 2D and 3D information separately, while jointly leveraging these two sources may foster a more informative representation. In this work, we explore this appealing idea and propose a new representation learning method based on a unified 2D and 3D pre-training. Atom coordinates and interatomic distances are encoded and then fused with atomic representations through graph neural networks. The model is pre-trained on three tasks: reconstruction of masked atoms and coordinates, 3D conformation generation conditioned on 2D graph, and 2D graph generation conditioned on 3D conformation. We evaluate our method on 11 downstream molecular property prediction tasks: 7 with 2D information only and 4 with both 2D and 3D information. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 tasks, and the average improvement on 2D-only tasks is 8.3%.

    "abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs) are the de facto standard for analyzing comprehensive patient conditions. Existing methods mainly employ specialized neural networks to extract modality-specific information, followed by modality correlation modeling to support clinical decision-making. However, these methods generally overlook the issue of ''contaminated'' representations inherent in routine EHR data, which can undermine the model's discriminative ability, as less relevant representations associated with false positive correlations may impede the recognition of truly effective representations. To address the issue of representation contamination, we propose CLEAR, a counterfactual disparity learning model for explicit multimodal EHR analytics. The core idea is to first model the contamination in representations, and subsequently perform calibration and enhancement to construct highly discriminative representations. Specifically, CLEAR first proposes the Counterfactual Prompt Learning Module to capture the representation discrepancy to model representation contamination. Subsequently, an Adaptive Dynamic Imputation Module is devised to decouple the elementwise representations for representation calibration, while a gating mechanism is further proposed to incorporate discriminative discrepancy information for representation enhancement. Finally, the Multimodal Representation Fusion Module establishes intra- and inter-modality correlations, thereby creating a seamless integration towards downstream analytic tasks. To our knowledge, CLEAR is the first to model and resolve representation contamination in multimodal EHR analytics. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that CLEAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in facilitating multimodal healthcare analytics.",

    "abstract": "Retrosynthetic planning, which aims to find a reaction pathway to synthesize a target molecule, plays an important role in chemistry and drug discovery. This task is usually modeled as a search problem. Recently, data-driven methods have attracted many research interests and shown promising results for retrosynthetic planning. We observe that the same intermediate molecules are visited many times in the searching process, and they are usually independently treated in previous tree-based methods (e.g., AND-OR tree search, Monte Carlo tree search). Such redundancies make the search process inefficient. We propose a graph-based search policy that eliminates the redundant explorations of any intermediate molecules. As searching over a graph is more complicated than over a tree, we further adopt a graph neural network to guide the search over graphs. Meanwhile, our method can search a batch of targets together in the graph and remove the inter-target duplication in the tree-based search methods. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Especially on the widely used USPTO benchmark, we improve the search success rate to 99.47%, advancing previous state-of-the-art performance for 2.6 points.",

Given a dataset which records information about the spread of a disease over a set of locations, we consider the problem of identifying both the disease's intrinsic waves (temporal patterns) and their respective spatial epicenters. To do so we introduce a new method of spatio-temporal decomposition which we call diffusion NMF (D-NMF). Building upon classic matrix factorization methods, D-NMF takes into consideration a spatial structuring of locations (features) in the data and supports the idea that locations which are spatially close are more likely to experience the same set of waves. To illustrate the use of D-NMF, we analyze Covid case data at various spatial granularities. Our results demonstrate that D-NMF is very useful in separating the waves of an epidemic and identifying a few centers for each wave.",

Learning simple and interpretable models is as important as mere classification accuracy. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for classifying brain networks based on extracting contrast subgraphs, i.e., a set of vertices whose induced subgraphs are dense in one class of graphs and sparse in the other. We formally define the problem and present an algorithmic solution for extracting contrast subgraphs. We then apply our method to a brain-network dataset consisting of children affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder and children Typically Developed. Our analysis confirms the interestingness of the discovered patterns, which match background knowledge in the neuro-science literature. Further analysis on other classification tasks confirm the simplicity, soundness, and high explainability of our proposal, which also exhibits superior classification accuracy, to more complex state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "The goal of spatially explainable artificial intelligence (AI) classification approach is to build a classifier to distinguish two classes (e.g., responder, non-responder) based on the their spatial arrangements (e.g., spatial interactions between different point categories) given multi-category point data from two classes. This problem is important for generating hypotheses towards discovering new immunotherapies for cancer treatment as well as for other applications in biomedical research and microbial ecology. This problem is challenging due to an exponential number of category subsets which may vary in the strength of their spatial interactions. Most prior efforts on using human selected spatial association measures may not be sufficient for capturing the relevant spatial interactions (e.g., surrounded by) which may be of biological significance. In addition, the related deep neural networks are limited to category pairs and do not explore larger subsets of point categories. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Spatial-interaction Aware Multi-Category deep neural Network (SAMCNet) architecture and contribute novel local reference frame characterization and point pair prioritization layers for spatially explainable classification. Experimental results on multiple cancer datasets (e.g., MxIF) show that the proposed architecture provides higher prediction accuracy over baseline methods. A real-world case study demonstrates that the proposed work discovers patterns that are missed by the existing methods and has the potential to inspire new scientific discoveries.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained concept representations are essential to many biomedical text mining and natural language processing tasks. As such, various representation learning approaches have been proposed in the literature. More recently, contextualized embedding approaches (i.e., BERT based models) that capture the implicit semantics of concepts at a granular level have significantly outperformed the conventional word embedding approaches (i.e., Word2Vec/GLoVE based models). Despite significant accuracy gains achieved, these approaches are often computationally expensive and memory inefficient. To address this issue, we propose a new representation learning approach that efficiently adapts the concept representations to the newly available data. Specifically, the proposed approach develops a knowledge-guided continual learning strategy wherein the accurate/stable context-information present in human-curated knowledge-bases is exploited to continually identify and retrain the representations of those concepts whose corpus-based context evolved coherently over time. Different from previous studies that mainly leverage the curated knowledge to improve the accuracy of embedding models, the proposed research explores the usefulness of semantic knowledge from the perspective of accelerating the training efficiency of embedding models. Comprehensive experiments under various efficiency constraints demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the computational performance of biomedical word embedding models.",

    "abstract": "Bipartite ranking, which aims to learn a scoring function that ranks positive individuals higher than negative ones from labeled data, is widely adopted in various applications where sample prioritization is needed. Recently, there have been rising concerns on whether the learned scoring function can cause systematic disparity across different protected groups defined by sensitive attributes. While there could be trade-off between fairness and performance, in this paper we propose a model agnostic post-processing framework for balancing them in the bipartite ranking scenario. Specifically, we maximize a weighted sum of the utility and fairness by directly adjusting the relative ordering of samples across groups. By formulating this problem as the identification of an optimal warping path across different protected groups, we propose a non-parametric method to search for such an optimal path through a dynamic programming process. Our method is compatible with various classification models and applicable to a variety of ranking fairness metrics. Comprehensive experiments on a suite of benchmark data sets and two real-world patient electronic health record repositories show that our method can achieve a great balance between the algorithm utility and ranking fairness. Furthermore, we experimentally verify the robustness of our method when faced with the fewer training samples and the difference between training and testing ranking score distributions.",

    "abstract": "Survival analysis is widely used as a technique to model time-to-event data when some data is censored, particularly in healthcare for predicting future patient risk. In such settings, survival models must be both accurate and interpretable so that users (such as doctors) can trust the model and understand model predictions. While most literature focuses on discrimination, interpretability is equally as important. A successful interpretable model should be able to describe how changing each feature impacts the outcome, and should only use a small number of features. In this paper, we present DyS (pronounced \"dice''), a new survival analysis model that achieves both strong discrimination and interpretability. DyS is a feature-sparse Generalized Additive Model, combining feature selection and interpretable prediction into one model. While DyS works well for all survival analysis problems, it is particularly useful for large (innandp) survival datasets such as those commonly found in observational healthcare studies. Empirical studies show that DyS competes with other state-of-the-art machine learning models for survival analysis, while being highly interpretable.",

    "abstract": "Geographic health disparities pose a pressing global challenge, particularly in underserved regions of low- and middle-income nations. Addressing this issue requires a collaborative approach to enhance healthcare quality, leveraging support from medically more developed areas. Federated learning emerges as a promising tool for this purpose. However, the scarcity of medical data and limited computation resources in underserved regions make collaborative training of powerful machine learning models challenging. Furthermore, there exists an asymmetrical reciprocity between underserved and developed regions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel cross-silo federated learning framework, named FedHelp, aimed at alleviating geographic health disparities and fortifying the diagnostic capabilities of underserved regions. Specifically, FedHelp leverages foundational model knowledge via one-time API access to guide the learning process of underserved small clients, addressing the challenge of insufficient data. Additionally, we introduce a novel asymmetric dual knowledge distillation module to manage the issue of asymmetric reciprocity, facilitating the exchange of necessary knowledge between developed large clients and underserved small clients. We validate the effectiveness and utility of FedHelp through extensive experiments on both medical image classification and segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines, particularly benefiting clients in underserved regions.",

    "abstract": "The opioid crisis has been one of the most critical society concerns in the United States. Although the medication assisted treatment (MAT) is recognized as the most effective treatment for opioid misuse and addiction, the various side effects can trigger opioid relapse. In addition to MAT, the dietary nutrition intervention has been demonstrated its importance in opioid misuse prevention and recovery. However, research on the alarming connections between dietary patterns and opioid misuse remain under-explored. In response to this gap, in this paper, we first establish a large-scale multifaceted dietary benchmark dataset related to opioid users at the first attempt and then develop a novel framework - i.e., namely Opioid Misuse Detection with INterpretable Dietary Patterns (Diet-ODIN) - to bridge heterogeneous graph (HG) and large language model (LLM) for the identification of users with opioid misuse and the interpretation of their associated dietary patterns. Specifically, in Diet-ODIN, we first construct an HG to comprehensively incorporate both dietary and health-related information, and then we devise a holistic graph learning framework with noise reduction to fully capitalize both users' individual dietary habits and shared dietary patterns for the detection of users with opioid misuse. To further delve into the intricate correlations between dietary patterns and opioid misuse, we exploit an LLM by utilizing the knowledge obtained from the graph learning model for interpretation. The extensive experimental results based on our established benchmark with quantitative and qualitative measures demonstrate the outstanding performance of Diet-ODIN on exploring the complex interplay between opioid misuse and dietary patterns, by comparison with state-of-the-art baseline methods. Our code, built benchmark and system demo are available at https://github.com/JasonZhangzy1757/Diet-ODIN.",

However, none of the existing techniques is able to identify the causal profile, the temporal pattern that the causal variable needs to follow in order to trigger the most significant change in the outcome. Toward a new horizon, this study introduces the novel problem of Causal Profile Discovery, which is crucial for many applications such as adverse drug reaction and cyber-attack detection. This work correspondingly proposes Heidegger to discover causal profiles, comprised of a flexible randomized block design for hypothesis evaluation and an efficient profile search via on-the-fly graph construction and entropy-based pruning. Heidegger's performance is demonstrated/evaluated extensively on both synthetic and real-world data. The experimental results show the proposed method is robust to noise and flexible at detecting complex patterns.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19 Disease due to the novel coronavirus has caused a shortage of medical resources. To aid and accelerate the diagnosis process, automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 via deep learning models has recently been explored by researchers across the world. While different data-driven deep learning models have been developed to mitigate the diagnosis of COVID-19, the data itself is still scarce due to patient privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) is a natural solution because it allows different organizations to cooperatively learn an effective deep learning model without sharing raw data. However, recent studies show that FL still lacks privacy protection and may cause data leakage. We investigate this challenging problem by proposing a simple yet effective algorithm, named Federated Learning on Medical Datasets using Partial Networks (FLOP), that shares only a partial model between the server and clients. Extensive experiments on benchmark data and real-world healthcare tasks show that our approach achieves comparable or better performance while reducing the privacy and security risks. Of particular interest, we conduct experiments on the COVID-19 dataset and find that our FLOP algorithm can allow different hospitals to collaboratively and effectively train a partially shared model without sharing local patients' data.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized molecule representation learning by modeling molecules as graphs, with atoms represented as nodes and chemical bonds as edges. Despite their progress, they struggle with out-of-distribution scenarios, such as changes in size or scaffold of molecules with identical properties. Some studies attempt to mitigate this issue through graph invariant learning, which penalizes prediction variance across environments to learn invariant representations. But in the realm of molecules, core functional groups forming privileged substructures dominate molecular properties and remain invariant across distribution shifts. This highlights the need for integrating this prior knowledge and ensuring the environment split compatible with molecule invariant learning. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework named MILI. Specifically, we first formalize molecule invariant learning based on privileged substructure identification and introduce substructure invariance constraint. Building on this foundation, we theoretically establish two criteria for environment splits conducive to molecule invariant learning. Inspired by these criteria, we develop a dual-head graph neural network. A shared identifier identifies privileged substructures, while environment and task heads generate predictions based on variant and privileged substructures. Through the interaction of two heads, the environments are split and optimized to meet our criteria. The unified MILI guarantees that molecule invariant learning and environment split achieve mutual enhancement from theoretical analysis and network design. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks validate the effectiveness of MILI compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "To represent the causal relationships between variables, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is widely utilized in many areas, such as social sciences, epidemics, and genetics. Many causal structure learning approaches are developed to learn the hidden causal structure using deep learning approaches. However, these approaches have a hidden assumption that the causal relationship remains unchanged over time, which may not hold in real life. In this paper, we develop a new framework to model the dynamic causal graph where the causal relations are allowed to be time-varying. We incorporate the basis approximation method into the score-based causal discovery approach to capture the dynamic pattern of causal graphs. Utilizing the autoregressive model structure, we could capture both contemporaneous and time-lagged causal relationships while allowing them to vary with time. We propose an algorithm that could provide both past-time estimates and future-time predictions on the causal graphs, and conduct simulations to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method. We also apply the proposed method for the covid-data analysis, and provide causal estimates on how the effect of policy restriction changes.",

    "abstract": "The core challenge of de novo protein design lies in creating proteins with specific functions or properties, guided by certain conditions. Current models explore to generate protein using structural and evolutionary guidance, which only provide indirect conditions concerning functions and properties. However, textual annotations of proteins, especially the annotations for protein domains, which directly describe the protein's high-level functionalities, properties, and their correlation with target amino acid sequences, remain unexplored in the context of protein design tasks. In this paper, we propose Protein-Annotation Alignment Generation PAAG, a multi-modality protein design framework that integrates the textual annotations extracted from protein database for controllable generation in sequence space. Specifically, within a multi-level alignment module, PAAG can explicitly generate proteins containing specific domains conditioned on the corresponding domain annotations, and can even design novel proteins with flexible combinations of different kinds of annotations. Our experimental results underscore the superiority of the aligned protein representations from PAAG over 7 prediction tasks. Furthermore, PAAG demonstrates a significant increase in generation success rate (24.7% vs 4.7% in zinc finger, and 54.3% vs 22.0% in the immunoglobulin domain) in comparison to the existing model. We anticipate that PAAG will broaden the horizons of protein design by leveraging the knowledge from between textual annotation and proteins.",

To discover invariant and changing mechanisms from data, we propose extending the algorithmic model for causation to mechanism changes and instantiating it using Minimum Description Length. In essence, for a continuous variable Y in multiple contexts C, we identify variables X as causal if the regression functions g : X → Y have succinct descriptions in all contexts. In empirical evaluations we show that our method, VARIO, finds invariant variable sets, reveals mechanism changes, and discovers causal networks, such as on real-world data that gives insight into the signaling pathways in human immune cells.",

To do so, we first assume a causal relationship based on the domain knowledge of molecular sciences and construct a structural causal model (SCM) that reveals the relationship between variables. Based on the SCM, we introduce a novel conditional intervention framework whose intervention is conditioned on the paired molecule. With the conditional intervention framework, our model successfully learns from the causal substructure and alleviates the confounding effect of shortcut substructures that are spuriously correlated to chemical reactions. Extensive experiments on various tasks with real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMRL over state-of-the-art baseline models.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that is the leading cause of mortality in hospital intensive care units (ICUs). Identification of sepsis subphenotypes may allow for more precise treatments and lead to more targeted clinical interventions. Recently, sepsis subtyping on electronic health records (EHRs) has attracted interest from healthcare researchers. However, most sepsis subtyping studies ignore the temporality of EHR data and suffer from missing values. In this paper, we propose a new sepsis subtyping framework to address the two issues. Our subtyping framework consists of a novel Time-Aware Multi-modal auto-Encoder (TAME) model which introduces time-aware attention mechanism and incorporates multi-modal inputs (e.g., demographics, diagnoses, medications, lab tests and vital signs) to impute missing values, a dynamic time wrapping (DTW) method to measure patients' temporal similarity based on the imputed EHR data, and a weighted k-means algorithm to cluster patients. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets show TAME outperforms the baselines on imputation accuracy. After analyzing TAME-imputed EHR data, we identify four novel subphenotypes of sepsis patients, paving the way for improved personalization of sepsis management.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed remarkable success achieved by graph neural networks (GNNs) in many real-world applications such as recommendation and drug discovery. Despite the success, oversmoothing has been identified as one of the key issues which limit the performance of deep GNNs. It indicates that the learned node representations are highly indistinguishable due to the stacked aggregators. In this paper, we propose a new perspective to look at the performance degradation of deep GNNs, i.e., feature overcorrelation. Through empirical and theoretical study on this matter, we demonstrate the existence of feature overcorrelation in deeper GNNs and reveal potential reasons leading to this issue. To reduce the feature correlation, we propose a general framework DeCorr which can encourage GNNs to encode less redundant information. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that DeCorr can help enable deeper GNNs and is complementary to existing techniques tackling the oversmoothing issue.",

    "abstract": "To provide accurate and explainable misinformation detection, it is often useful to take an auxiliary source (e.g., social context and knowledge base) into consideration. Existing methods use social contexts such as users' engagements as complementary information to improve detection performance and derive explanations. However, due to the lack of sufficient professional knowledge, users seldom respond to healthcare information, which makes these methods less applicable. In this work, to address these shortcomings, we propose a novel knowledge guided graph attention network for detecting health misinformation better. Our proposal, named as DETERRENT, leverages on the additional information from medical knowledge graph by propagating information along with the network, incorporates a Medical Knowledge Graph and an Article-Entity Bipartite Graph, and propagates the node embeddings through Knowledge Paths. In addition, an attention mechanism is applied to calculate the importance of entities to each article, and the knowledge guided article embeddings are used for misinformation detection. DETERRENT addresses the limitation on social contexts in the healthcare domain and is capable of providing useful explanations for the results of detection. Empirical validation using two real-world datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of DETERRENT. Comparing with the best results of eight competing methods, in terms of F1 Score, DETERRENT outperforms all methods by at least 4.78% on the diabetes dataset and 12.79% on cancer dataset. We release the source code of DETERRENT at: https://github.com/cuilimeng/DETERRENT.",

    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in developed countries. Identifying patients at high risk of progression to late AMD, the sight-threatening stage, is critical for clinical actions, including medical interventions and timely monitoring. Recently, deep-learning-based models have been developed and achieved superior performance for late AMD prediction. However, most existing methods are limited to the color fundus photography (CFP) from the last ophthalmic visit and do not include the longitudinal CFP history and AMD progression during the previous years' visits. Patients in different AMD subphenotypes might have various speeds of progression in different stages of AMD disease. Capturing the progression information during the previous years' visits might be useful for the prediction of AMD progression. In this work, we propose a C ontrastive-A ttention-based T ime-aware L ong S hort-T erm M emory network (CAT-LSTM ) to predict AMD progression. First, we adopt a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with a contrastive attention module (CA) to extract abnormal features from CFPs. Then we utilize a time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM) to model the patients' history and consider the AMD progression information. The combination of disease progression, genotype information, demographics, and CFP features are sent to T-LSTM. Moreover, we leverage an auto-encoder to represent temporal CFP sequences as fixed-size vectors and adopt k-means to cluster them into subphenotypes. We evaluate the proposed model based on real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed model could achieve 0.925 on area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) for 5-year late-AMD prediction and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by more than 3%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed CAT-LSTM. After analyzing patient representation learned by an auto-encoder, we identify 3 novel subphenotypes of AMD patients with different characteristics and progression rates to late AMD, paving the way for improved personalization of AMD management. The code of CAT-LSTM can be found at https://github.com/yinchangchang/CAT-LSTM .",

    "abstract": "Medical entity relation verification is a crucial step to build a practical and enterprise medical knowledge graph (MKG) because high-precision medical entity relation is a key requirement for many MKG-based applications. Existing relation verification approaches for general knowledge graphs are not designed for considering medical domain knowledge, although it is central to achieve high-quality entity relation verification for MKG. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a system for medical entity relation verification with large-scale machine reading comprehension. The proposed system is tailored to overcome the unique challenges of medical relation verification including high variants of medical terms, the high difficulty of evidence searching in complex medical documents, and the lack of evidence labels for supervision. To deal with the problem of variants of medical terms, we introduce a synonym-aware retrieve model to retrieve the potential evidence implicitly verifying the given claim. To better utilize the medical domain knowledge, a relation-aware evidence detector and a medical ontology-enhanced aggregator are developed to improve the performance of the relation verification module. Moreover, to overcome the challenge of providing high-quality evidence due to the lack of labels, we introduce an interactive collaborative-training method to iteratively improve the evidence accuracy. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the performance of our proposed system is superior to all comparable models. We also demonstrate that our system can significantly reduce the annotation time by medical experts in real-world verification tasks. It can help to improve the efficiency by nearly 300%. In particular, our system has been embedded into the Baidu Clinical Decision Support System.",

Existing computational drug discovery methods mainly depend on molecule databases, ignoring valuable data collected from clinical trials. In this work, we propose PRIME to leverage high-quality drug molecules and drug-disease relations in historical clinical trials to narrow down the molecular search space in drug discovery. PRIME also introduces time dependency constraints to model evolving drug-disease relations using a probabilistic deep learning model that can quantify model uncertainty. We evaluated PRIME against leading models on both de novo design and drug repurposing tasks. Results show that compared with the best baselines, PRIME achieves 25.9% relative improvement (i.e., reduction) in average hit-ranking on drug repurposing and 47.6% relative improvement in success rate on de novo design.",

    "abstract": "The growing availability of well-organized Electronic Health Records (EHR) data has enabled the development of various machine learning models towards disease risk prediction. However, existing risk prediction methods overlook the heterogeneity of complex diseases, failing to model the potential disease subtypes regarding their corresponding patient visits and clinical concept subgroups. In this work, we introduce TACCO, a novel framework that jointly discovers clusters of clinical concepts and patient visits based on a hypergraph modeling of EHR data. Specifically, we develop a novel self-supervised co-clustering framework that can be guided by the risk prediction task of specific diseases. Furthermore, we enhance the hypergraph model of EHR data with textual embeddings and enforce the alignment between the clusters of clinical concepts and patient visits through a contrastive objective. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the public MIMIC-III dataset and Emory internal CRADLE dataset over the downstream clinical tasks of phenotype classification and cardiovascular risk prediction demonstrate an average 31.25% performance improvement compared to traditional ML baselines and a 5.26% improvement on top of the vanilla hypergraph model without our co-clustering mechanism. In-depth model analysis, clustering results analysis, and clinical case studies further validate the improved utilities and insightful interpretations delivered by TACCO.

    "abstract": "Multi-action restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) are a powerful framework for constrained resource allocation in which N independent processes are managed. However, previous work only study the offline setting where problem dynamics are known. We address this restrictive assumption, designing the first algorithms for learning good policies for Multi-action RMABs online using combinations of Lagrangian relaxation and Q-learning. Our first approach, MAIQL, extends a method for Q-learning the Whittle index in binary-action RMABs to the multi-action setting. We derive a generalized update rule and convergence proof and establish that, under standard assumptions, MAIQL converges to the asymptotically optimal multi-action RMAB policy as t → ∞. However, MAIQL relies on learning Q-functions and indexes on two timescales which leads to slow convergence and requires problem structure to perform well. Thus, we design a second algorithm, LPQL, which learns the well-performing and more general Lagrange policy for multi-action RMABs by learning to minimize the Lagrange bound through a variant of Q-learning. To ensure fast convergence, we take an approximation strategy that enables learning on a single timescale, then give a guarantee relating the approximation's precision to an upper bound of LPQL's return as t → ∞. Finally, we show that our approaches always outperform baselines across multiple settings, including one derived from real-world medication adherence data.",

These results highlight the potential of deep learning to significantly advance protein sequence annotation, but this particular system is not a practical tool for many biologists because of the computational burden of making predictions using a large ensemble. In this work, we fine-tune a transformer model that is pre-trained on millions of unlabeled natural protein sequences in order to reduce the system's compute burden at prediction time and improve accuracy. By switching from a CNN to the pre-trained transformer, we lift performance from 73.6% to 90.5% using a single model on a challenging clustering-based train-test split, where the ensemble of 59 CNNs achieved 89.0%. Through extensive stratified analysis of model performance, we provide evidence that the new model's predictions are trustworthy, even in cases known to be challenging for prior methods. Finally, we provide a case study of the biological insight enabled by this approach.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce ChemicalX, a PyTorch-based deep learning library designed for providing a range of state of the art models to solve the drug pair scoring task. The primary objective of the library is to make deep drug pair scoring models accessible to machine learning researchers and practitioners in a streamlined framework. The design of ChemicalX reuses existing high level model training utilities, geometric deep learning, and deep chemistry layers from the PyTorch ecosystem. Our system provides neural network layers, custom pair scoring architectures, data loaders, and batch iterators for end users. We showcase these features with example code snippets and case studies to highlight the characteristics of ChemicalX. A range of experiments on real world drug-drug interaction, polypharmacy side effect, and combination synergy prediction tasks demonstrate that the models available in ChemicalX are effective at solving the pair scoring task. Finally, we show that ChemicalX could be used to train and score machine learning models on large drug pair datasets with hundreds of thousands of compounds on commodity hardware.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of leveraging dialogue agents learned from reinforcement learning (RL) that can interact with patients for automatic disease screening. This application requires efficient and effective inquiry of appropriate symptoms to make accurate diagnosis recommendations. Existing studies have tried to use RL to perform both symptom inquiry and diagnosis simultaneously, which needs to deal with a large, heterogeneous action space that affects the learning efficiency and effectiveness. To address the challenge, we propose to leverage the models learned from the dialogue data to customize the settings of the reinforcement learning for more efficient action space exploration. In particular, a supervised diagnosis model is built and involved in the definition of state and reward. We also develop the clustering method to form a hierarchy in the action space. These customizations can make the learning task focus on checking the most relevant symptoms, which effectively boost the confidence of diagnosis. Besides, a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with the pretraining strategy is used to reduce the dimension of action space and help the model to converge. For empirical evaluations, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results have demonstrated the superiority of our approach in diagnostic accuracy and interaction efficiency compared with other baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of online medical platforms, more and more doctors are willing to manage and communicate with patients via online services. Considering the large volume and various patient conditions, identifying and classifying patients' medical records has become a crucial problem. To efficiently index these records, a common practice is to annotate them with semantically meaningful tags. However, manual labeling tags by doctors is impractical due to the possibility of thousands of tag candidates, which necessitates a tag recommender system. Due to the long tail distribution of tags and the dominance of low-activity doctors, as well as the unique uploaded medical records, this task is rather challenging. This paper proposes an efficient doctor specific tag recommendation framework for improved medical record management without side information. Specifically, we first utilize effective language models to learn the text representation. Then, we construct a doctor embedding learning module to enhance the recommendation quality by integrating implicit information within text representations and considering latent tag correlations to make more accurate predictions. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework from the viewpoints of all doctors (20% improvement) or low-activity doctors (10% improvement).",

    "abstract": "Generalist Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown considerable promise in various domains, including medical diagnosis. Rare diseases, affecting approximately 300 million people worldwide, often have unsatisfactory clinical diagnosis rates primarily due to a lack of experienced physicians and the complexity of differentiating among many rare diseases. In this context, recent news such as \"ChatGPT correctly diagnosed a 4-year-old's rare disease after 17 doctors failed\" underscore LLMs' potential, yet underexplored, role in clinically diagnosing rare diseases. To bridge this research gap, we introduce RareBench, a pioneering benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of LLMs on 4 critical dimensions within the realm of rare diseases. Meanwhile, we have compiled the largest open-source dataset on rare disease patients, establishing a benchmark for future studies in this domain. To facilitate differential diagnosis of rare diseases, we develop a dynamic few-shot prompt methodology, leveraging a comprehensive rare disease knowledge graph synthesized from multiple knowledge bases, significantly enhancing LLMs' diagnostic performance. Moreover, we present an exhaustive comparative study of GPT-4's diagnostic capabilities against those of specialist physicians. Our experimental findings underscore the promising potential of integrating LLMs into the clinical diagnostic process for rare diseases. This paves the way for exciting possibilities in future advancements in this field.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide variety of domains. Nonetheless, generalist LLMs continue to fall short in reasoning tasks necessitating specialized knowledge, e.g., emotional sociology and medicine. Prior investigations into specialized LLMs focused on domain-specific training, which entails substantial efforts in domain data acquisition and model parameter fine-tuning. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Way-to-Specialist (WTS) framework, which synergizes retrieval-augmented generation with knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the specialized capability of LLMs in the absence of specialized training. In distinction to existing paradigms that merely utilize external knowledge from general KGs or static domain KGs to prompt LLM for enhanced domain-specific reasoning, WTS proposes an innovative ''LLM↻KG'' paradigm, which achieves bidirectional enhancement between specialized LLM and domain knowledge graph (DKG). The proposed paradigm encompasses two closely coupled components: theDKG-Augmented LLMand theLLM-Assisted DKG Evolution.The former retrieves question-relevant domain knowledge from DKG and uses it to prompt LLM to enhance the reasoning capability for domain-specific tasks; the latter leverages LLM to generate new domain knowledge from processed tasks and use it to evolve DKG. WTS closes the loop betweenDKG-Augmented LLMandLLM-Assisted DKG Evolution,enabling continuous improvement in the domain specialization as it progressively answers and learns from domain-specific questions. We validate the performance of WTS on 7 datasets (e.g., TweetQA, ChatDoctor5k) spanning 6 domains, e.g., emotional sociology, medical, ect. The experimental results show that WTS surpasses the previous SOTA in 5 specialized domains, and achieves a maximum performance improvement of 11.3%.",

    "abstract": "The fraudulent insurance claim is critical for the insurance industry. Insurance companies or agency platforms aim to confidently estimate the fraud risk of claims by gathering data from various sources. Although more data sources can improve the estimation accuracy, they inevitably lead to increased costs. Therefore, a great challenge of fraud risk verification lies in well balancing these two aspects. To this end, this paper proposes a framework named cost-efficient fraud risk optimization with submodularity (CEROS) to optimize the process of fraud risk verification. CEROS efficiently allocates investigation resources across multiple information sources, balancing the trade-off between accuracy and cost. CEROS consists of two parts that we propose: a submodular set-wise classification model called SSCM to estimate the submodular objective function, and a primal-dual algorithm with segmentation point called PDA-SP to solve the objective function. Specifically, SSCM models the fraud probability associated with multiple information sources and ensures the properties of submodularity of fraud risk without making independence assumption. The submodularity in SSCM enables PDA-SP to significantly speed up dual optimization. Theoretically, we disclose that when PDA-SP optimizes this dual optimization problem, the process is monotonicity. Finally, the trade-off coefficients output by PDA-SP that balance accuracy and cost in fraud risk verification are applied to online insurance claim decision-making. We conduct experiments on offline trials and online A/B tests in two business areas at Alipay: healthcare insurance recommendation and claim verification. The extensive results indicate that, compared with other methods, CEROS achieves acceleration of 66.9% in convergence speed and meanwhile 18.8% in cost reduction. Currently, CEROS has been successfully deployed in Alipay.",

    "abstract": "In medical insurance industry, a lot of human labor is required to collect information of claimants. Human assessors need to converse with claimants in order to record key information and organize it into a structured summary. With the purpose of helping save human labor, we propose the task of conversation-oriented structured summarization which aims to automatically produce the desired structured summary from a conversation automatically. One major challenge of the task is that the structured summary contains multiple fields of different types. To tackle this problem, we propose a unified approach COSSUM based on prompting to generate the values of all fields simultaneously. By learning all fields together, our approach can capture the inherent relationship between them. Moreover, we propose a specially designed curriculum learning strategy for model training. Both automatic and human evaluations are performed, and the results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised approaches for electroencephalography (EEG) representation learning face three specific challenges inherent to EEG data: (1) The low signal-to-noise ratio which challenges the quality of the representation learned, (2) The wide range of amplitudes from very small to relatively large due to factors such as the inter-subject variability, risks the models to be dominated by higher amplitude ranges, and (3) The absence of explicit segmentation in the continuous-valued sequences which can result in less informative representations. To address these challenges, we introduceEEG2Rep,a self-prediction approach for self-supervised representation learning from EEG. Two core novel components of EEG2Rep are as follows: 1) Instead of learning to predict the masked input from raw EEG, EEG2Rep learns to predict masked input in latent representation space, and 2) Instead of conventional masking methods, EEG2Rep uses a new semantic subsequence preserving (SSP) method which provides informative masked inputs to guide EEG2Rep to generate rich semantic representations. In experiments on 6 diverse EEG tasks with subject variability, EEG2Rep significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We show that our semantic subsequence preserving improves the existing masking methods in self-prediction literature and find that preserving 50% of EEG recordings will result in the most accurate results on all 6 tasks on average. Finally, we show that EEG2Rep is robust to noise addressing a significant challenge that exists in EEG data. Models and code are available at:https://github.com/Navidfoumani/EEG2Rep",

    "abstract": "Drug recommendation is an important task of AI for healthcare. To recommend proper drugs, existing methods rely on various clinical records (e.g., diagnosis and procedures), which are commonly found in data such as electronic health records (EHRs). However, detailed records as such are often not available and the inputs might merely include a set of symptoms provided by doctors. Moreover, existing drug recommender systems usually treat drugs as individual items, ignoring the unique requirements that drug recommendation has to be done on a set of items (drugs), which should be as small as possible and safe without harmful drug-drug interactions (DDIs). To deal with the challenges above, in this paper, we propose a novel framework of Symptom-based Set-to-set Small and Safe drug recommendation (4SDrug). To enable set-to-set comparison, we design set-oriented representation and similarity measurement for both symptoms and drugs. Further, towards the symptom sets, we devise importance-based set aggregation to enhance the accuracy of symptom set representation; towards the drug sets, we devise intersection-based set augmentation to ensure smaller drug sets, and apply knowledge-based and data-driven penalties to ensure safer drug sets. Extensive experiments on two real-world EHR datasets, i.e., the public benchmark one of MIMIC-III and the industrial large-scale one of NELL, show drastic performance gains brought by 4SDrug, which outperforms all baselines in most effectiveness measures, while yielding the smallest sets of recommended drugs and 26.83% DDI rate reduction from the ground-truth data.",

    "abstract": "Protecting the intellectual property (IP) of deep neural networks (DNN) becomes an urgent concern for IT corporations. For model piracy forensics, previous model fingerprinting schemes are commonly based on adversarial examples constructed for the owner's model as the fingerprint, and verify whether a suspect model is indeed pirated from the original model by matching the behavioral pattern on the fingerprint examples between one another. However, these methods heavily rely on the characteristics of classification tasks which inhibits their application to more general scenarios. To address this issue, we present MetaV, the first task-agnostic model fingerprinting framework which enables fingerprinting on a much wider range of DNNs independent from the downstream learning task, and exhibits strong robustness against a variety of ownership obfuscation techniques. Specifically, we generalize previous schemes into two critical design components in MetaV: the adaptive fingerprint and the meta-verifier, which are jointly optimized such that the meta-verifier learns to determine whether a suspect model is stolen based on the concatenated outputs of the suspect model on the adaptive fingerprint. As a key of being task-agnostic, the full process makes no assumption on the model internals in the ensemble only if they have the same input and output dimensions. Spanning classification, regression and generative modeling, extensive experimental results validate the substantially improved performance of MetaV over the state-of-the-art fingerprinting schemes and demonstrate the enhanced generality of MetaV for providing task-agnostic fingerprinting.

    "abstract": "Brain graphs, which model the structural and functional relationships between brain regions, are crucial in neuroscientific and clinical applications that can be formulated as graph classification tasks. However, dense brain graphs pose computational challenges such as large time and memory consumption and poor model interpretability. In this paper, we investigate effective designs in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to sparsify brain graphs by eliminating noisy edges. Many prior works select noisy edges based on explainability or task-irrelevant properties, but this does not guarantee performance improvement when using the sparsified graphs. Additionally, the selection of noisy edges is often tailored to each individual graph, making it challenging to sparsify multiple graphs collectively using the same approach. To address the issues above, we first introduce an iterative framework to analyze the effectiveness of different sparsification models. By utilizing this framework, we find that (i) methods that prioritize interpretability may not be suitable for graph sparsification, as the sparsified graphs may degenerate the performance of GNN models; (ii) it is beneficial to learn the edge selection during the training of the GNN, rather than after the GNN has converged; (iii) learning a joint edge selection shared across all graphs achieves higher performance than generating separate edge selection for each graph; and (iv) gradient information, which is task-relevant, helps with edge selection. Based on these insights, we propose a new model, Interpretable Graph Sparsification (IGS), which improves the graph classification performance by up to 5.1% with 55.0% fewer edges than the original graphs. The retained edges identified by IGS provide neuroscientific interpretations and are supported by well-established literature.",

    "abstract": "A primary challenge in metagenomics is reconstructing individual microbial genomes from the mixture of short fragments created by sequencing. Recent work leverages the sparsity of the assembly graph to find r-dominating sets which enable rapid approximate queries through a dominator-centric graph partition. In this paper, we consider two problems related to reducing uncertainty and improving scalability in this setting. First, we observe that nodes with multiple closest dominators necessitate arbitrary tie-breaking in the existing pipeline. As such, we propose findingsparse dominating sets which minimize this effect via a newcongestion parameter. We prove minimizing congestion is NP-hard, and give an O (√Δr) approximation algorithm, where Δ is the max degree. To improve scalability, the graph should be partitioned into uniformly sized pieces, subject to placing vertices with a closest dominator. This leads to balanced neighborhood partitioning : given an r-dominating set, find a partition into connected subgraphs with optimal uniformity so that each vertex is co-assigned with some closest dominator. Using variance of piece sizes to measure uniformity, we show this problem is NP-hard iff r is greater than 1. We design and analyze several algorithms, including a polynomial-time approach which is exact when r=1 (and heuristic otherwise). We complement our theoretical results with computational experiments on a corpus of real-world networks showing sparse dominating sets lead to more balanced neighborhood partitionings. Further, on the metagenome fHuSB1, our approach maintains high query containment and similarity while reducing piece size variance.",

Traditionally, personalized dose finding process requires repeating clinical visits of the patient and frequent adjustments of the dosage. Thus the patient is constantly exposed to the risk of underdosing and overdosing during the process. Statistical methods for finding an optimal individualized dose rule can lower the costs and risks for patients. In this article, we propose a kernel assisted learning method for estimating the optimal individualized dose rule. The proposed methodology can also be applied to all other continuous decision-making problems. Advantages of the proposed method include robustness to model misspecification and capability of providing statistical inference for the estimated parameters. In the simulation studies, we show that this method is capable of identifying the optimal individualized dose rule and produces favorable expected outcomes in the population.

    "abstract": "The psychotherapy intervention technique is a multifaceted conversation between a therapist and a patient. Unlike general clinical discussions, psychotherapy's core components (viz. symptoms) are hard to distinguish, thus becoming a complex problem to summarize later. A structured counseling conversation may contain discussions about symptoms, history of mental health issues, or the discovery of the patient's behavior. It may also contain discussion filler words irrelevant to a clinical summary. We refer to these elements of structured psychotherapy as counseling components. In this paper, the aim is mental health counseling summarization to build upon domain knowledge and to help clinicians quickly glean meaning. We create a new dataset after annotating 12.9K utterances of counseling components and reference summaries for each dialogue. Further, we propose ConSum, a novel counseling-component guided summarization model. ConSum undergoes three independent modules. First, to assess the presence of depressive symptoms, it filters utterances utilizing the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), while the second and third modules aim to classify counseling components. At last, we propose a problem-specific Mental Health Information Capture (MHIC) evaluation metric for counseling summaries. Our comparative study shows that we improve on performance and generate cohesive, semantic, and coherent summaries. We comprehensively analyze the generated summaries to investigate the capturing of psychotherapy elements. Human and clinical evaluations on the summary show that ConSum generates quality summary. Further, mental health experts validate the clinical acceptability of the ConSum. Lastly, we discuss the uniqueness in mental health counseling summarization in the real world and show evidences of its deployment on an online application with the support of mpathic.ai",

To fill this need, this paper presents a novel counterfactual explanation framework for block maxima forecasting models. Unlike existing methods, our proposed framework,DiffusionCF, combines deep anomaly detection with a conditional diffusion model to identify unusual patterns in the time series that could help explain the forecasted extreme block maxima.

    "abstract": "Despite the recent progress of molecular representation learning, its effectiveness is assumed on the close-world assumptions that training and testing graphs are from identical distribution. The open-world test dataset is often mixed with out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, where the deployed models will struggle to make accurate predictions. The misleading estimations of molecules' properties in drug screening or design can result in the tremendous waste of wet-lab resources and delay the discovery of novel therapies. Traditional detection methods need to trade off OOD detection and in-distribution (ID) classification performance since they share the same representation learning model. In this work, we propose to detect OOD molecules by adopting an auxiliary diffusion model-based framework, which compares similarities between input molecules and reconstructed graphs. Due to the generative bias towards reconstructing ID training samples, the similarity scores of OOD molecules will be much lower to facilitate detection. Although it is conceptually simple, extending this vanilla framework to practical detection applications is still limited by two significant challenges. First, the popular similarity metrics based on Euclidian distance fail to consider the complex graph structure. Second, the generative model involving iterative denoising steps is notoriously time-consuming especially when it runs on the enormous pool of drugs. To address these challenges, our research pioneers an approach of Prototypical Graph Reconstruction for Molecular OOd Detection, dubbed as PGR-MOOD. Specifically, PGR-MOOD hinges on three innovations: i) An effective metric to comprehensively quantify the matching degree of input and reconstructed molecules according to their discrete edges and continuous node features; ii) A creative graph generator to construct a list of prototypical graphs that are in line with ID distribution but away from OOD one; iii) An efficient and scalable OOD detector to compare the similarity between test samples and pre-constructed prototypical graphs and omit the generative process on every new molecule. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets and six baselines are conducted to demonstrate our superiority: PGR-MOOD achieves more than 8% of average improvement in terms of detection AUC and AUPR accompanied by the reduced cost of testing time and memory consumption.

    "abstract": "Sepsis is an organ dysfunction caused by a deregulated immune response to an infection. Early sepsis prediction and identification allow for timely intervention, leading to improved clinical outcomes. Clinical calculators (e.g., the six-organ dysfunction assessment of SOFA) play a vital role in sepsis identification within clinicians' workflow, providing evidence-based risk assessments essential for sepsis diagnosis. However, artificial intelligence (AI) sepsis prediction models typically generate a single sepsis risk score without incorporating clinical calculators for assessing organ dysfunctions, making the models less convincing and transparent to clinicians. To bridge the gap, we propose to mimic clinicians' workflow with a novel framework SepsisCalc to integrate clinical calculators into the predictive model, yielding a clinically transparent and precise model for utilization in clinical settings. Practically, clinical calculators usually combine information from multiple component variables in Electronic Health Records (EHR), and might not be applicable when the variables are (partially) missing. We mitigate this issue by representing EHRs as temporal graphs and integrating a learning module to dynamically add the accurately estimated calculator to the graphs. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on sepsis prediction tasks. Moreover, we developed a system to identify organ dysfunctions and potential sepsis risks, providing a human-AI interaction tool for deployment, which can help clinicians understand the prediction outputs and prepare timely interventions for the corresponding dysfunctions, paving the way for actionable clinical decision-making support for early intervention.",

    "abstract": "Within the realm of drug development, the transition from successful animal trials to human clinical efficacy remains a daunting challenge. While initial outcomes may appear promising in animal studies, ensuring similar effectiveness in humans, especially across specific target tissues, presents a significant obstacle. To address this pressing concern, we introduce a novel generative model tailored to optimize molecules that have demonstrated efficacy in rats for enhanced performance in specific human tissues. Central to our solution is the transformer architecture, enhanced with intricate mechanisms such as molecule self-attention within the encoder and a novel dedicated tissue-specific generator. Intuitively, by learning to generate molecules simultaneously from multiple tissues, the generative model enhances its ability to perform the necessary adaptations from rats to humans. Through rigorous empirical evaluation across various tissues, our model consistently exhibits remarkable efficacy compared to existing methods. We anticipate that this model has the potential to minimize the requirement for lengthy and inconclusive trials, thereby streamlining the drug development process.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data are widely used in clinical applications. Conventional methods usually assume that each sample (patient) is associated with the unified observed modalities, and all modalities are available for each sample. However, missing modality caused by various clinical and social reasons is a common issue in real-world clinical scenarios. Existing methods mostly rely on solving a generative model that learns a mapping from the latent space to the original input space, which is an unstable ill-posed inverse problem. To relieve the underdetermined system, we propose a model solving a direct problem, dubbed learning with Missing Modalities in Multimodal healthcare data (M3Care). M3Care is an end-to-end model compensating the missing information of the patients with missing modalities to perform clinical analysis. Instead of generating raw missing data, M3Care imputes the task-related information of the missing modalities in the latent space by the auxiliary information from each patient's similar neighbors, measured by a task-guided modality-adaptive similarity metric, and thence conducts the clinical tasks. The task-guided modality-adaptive similarity metric utilizes the uncensored modalities of the patient and the other patients who also have the same uncensored modalities to find similar patients. Experiments on real-world datasets show that M3Care outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the findings discovered by M3Care are consistent with experts and medical knowledge, demonstrating the capability and the potential of providing useful insights and explanations.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trial digital twins are virtual patients that reflect personal characteristics in a high degree of granularity and can be used to simulate various patient outcomes under different conditions. With the growth of clinical trial databases captured by Electronic Data Capture (EDC) systems, there is a growing interest in using machine learning models to generate digital twins. This can benefit the drug development process by reducing the sample size required for participant recruitment, improving patient outcome predictive modeling, and mitigating privacy risks when sharing synthetic clinical trial data. However, prior research has mainly focused on generating Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs), which often assume large training data and do not account for personalized synthetic patient record generation. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient method TWIN for generating personalized clinical trial digital twins. TWIN can produce digital twins of patient-level clinical trial records with high fidelity to the targeting participant's record and preserves the temporal relations across visits and events. We compare our method with various baselines for generating real-world patient-level clinical trial data. The results show that TWIN generates synthetic trial data with high fidelity to facilitate patient outcome predictions in low-data scenarios and strong privacy protection against real patients from the trials.",

    "abstract": "Binary data with one-class missing values are ubiquitous in real-world applications. They can be represented by irregular tensors with varying sizes in one dimension, where value one means presence of a feature while zero means unknown (i.e., either presence or absence of a feature). Learning accurate low-rank approximations from such binary irregular tensors is a challenging task. However, none of the existing models developed for factorizing irregular tensors take the missing values into account, and they assume Gaussian distributions, resulting in a distribution mismatch when applied to binary data. In this paper, we propose Logistic PARAFAC2 (LogPar) by modeling the binary irregular tensor with Bernoulli distribution parameterized by an underlying real-valued tensor. Then we approximate the underlying tensor with a positive-unlabeled learning loss function to account for the missing values. We also incorporate uniqueness and temporal smoothness regularization to enhance the interpretability. Extensive experiments using large-scale real-world datasets show that LogPar outperforms all baselines in both irregular tensor completion and downstream predictive tasks. For the irregular tensor completion, LogPar achieves up to 26% relative improvement compared to the best baseline. Besides, LogPar obtains relative improvement of 13.2% for heart failure prediction and 14% for mortality prediction on average compared to the state-of-the-art PARAFAC2 models.",

    "abstract": "Protein interactions are important in a broad range of biological processes. Traditionally, computational methods have been developed to automatically predict protein interface from hand-crafted features. Recent approaches employ deep neural networks and predict the interaction of each amino acid pair independently. However, these methods do not incorporate the important sequential information from amino acid chains and the high-order pairwise interactions. Intuitively, the prediction of an amino acid pair should depend on both their features and the information of other amino acid pairs. In this work, we propose to formulate the protein interface prediction as a 2D dense prediction problem. In addition, we propose a novel deep model to incorporate the sequential information and high-order pairwise interactions to perform interface predictions. We represent proteins as graphs and employ graph neural networks to learn node features. Then we propose the sequential modeling method to incorporate the sequential information and reorder the feature matrix. Next, we incorporate high-order pairwise interactions to generate a 3D tensor containing different pairwise interactions. Finally, we employ convolutional neural networks to perform 2D dense predictions. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method can consistently improve the protein interface prediction performance.",

    "abstract": "Capturing molecular knowledge with representation learning approaches holds significant potential in vast scientific fields such as chemistry and life science. An effective and generalizable molecular representation is expected to capture the consensus and complementary molecular expertise from diverse views and perspectives. However, existing works fall short in learning multi-view molecular representations, due to challenges in explicitly incorporating view information and handling molecular knowledge from heterogeneous sources. To address these issues, we present MV-Mol, a molecular representation learning model that harvests multi-view molecular expertise from chemical structures, unstructured knowledge from biomedical texts, and structured knowledge from knowledge graphs. We utilize text prompts to model view information and design a fusion architecture to extract view-based molecular representations. We develop a two-stage pre-training procedure, exploiting heterogeneous data of varying quality and quantity. Through extensive experiments, we show that MV-Mol provides improved representations that substantially benefit molecular property prediction. Additionally, MV-Mol exhibits state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal comprehension of molecular structures and texts. Code and data are available at https://github.com/PharMolix/OpenBioMed.",

    "abstract": "Brain extraction and registration are important preprocessing steps in neuroimaging data analysis, where the goal is to extract the brain regions from MRI scans (ie extraction step) and align them with a target brain image (ie registration step). Conventional research mainly focuses on developing methods for the extraction and registration tasks separately under supervised settings. The performance of these methods highly depends on the amount of training samples and visual inspections performed by experts for error correction. However, in many medical studies, collecting voxel-level labels and conducting manual quality control in high-dimensional neuroimages (eg 3D MRI) are very expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, brain extraction and registration are highly related tasks in neuroimaging data and should be solved collectively. In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised collective extraction and registration in neuroimaging data. We propose a unified end-to-end framework, called ERNet (Extraction-Registration Network), to jointly optimize the extraction and registration tasks, allowing feedback between them. Specifically, we use a pair of multi-stage extraction and registration modules to learn the extraction mask and transformation, where the extraction network improves the extraction accuracy incrementally and the registration network successively warps the extracted image until it is well-aligned with the target image. Experiment results on real-world datasets show that our proposed method can effectively improve the performance on extraction and registration tasks in neuroimaging data.",

    "abstract": "Substance Use Disorder (SUD) is a devastating disease that leads to significant mental and behavioral impairments. Its negative effects damage the homeless youth population more severely (as compared to stably housed counterparts) because of their high-risk behaviors. To assist policymakers in devising effective and accurate long-term strategies to mitigate SUD, it is necessary to critically analyze environmental, psychological, and other factors associated with SUD among homeless youth. Unfortunately, there is no definitive data-driven study on analyzing factors associated with SUD among homeless youth. While there have been a few prior studies in the past, they (i) do not analyze variation in the associated factors for SUD with geographical heterogeneity in their studies; and (ii) only consider a few contributing factors to SUD in relatively small samples. This work aims to fill this gap by making the following three contributions: (i) we use a real-world dataset collected from ~1,400 homeless youth (across six American states) to build accurate Machine Learning (ML) models for predicting the susceptibility of homeless youth to SUD; (ii) we find a representative set of factors associated with SUD among this population by analyzing feature importance values associated with our ML models; and (iii) we investigate the effect of geographical heterogeneity on the factors associated with SUD. Our results show that our system using adaptively boosted decision trees achieves the best predictive accuracy out of several algorithms on the SUD prediction task, achieving an Area Under the ROC Curve of 0.85.

    "abstract": "Most existing brain imaging work focuses on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data where the subject is at rest in the scanner typically for disease diagnosis problems. Here we analyze task fMRI (t-fMRI) data where the subject performs a multi-event task over multiple trials. t-fMRI data allows exploring more challenging applications such as prognosis of treatment but at the cost of being more complex to analyze. Not only do multiple types of trials exist but the trials of each type are repeated a varying number of times for each subject. This leads to a multi-view (multiple types of trials) and multi-instance (multiple trials of each type of each subject) setting. We propose a deep multi-model architecture to encode multi-view brain activities from t-fMRI data and a multi-layer perceptron ensemble model to combine these view models and make subject-wise predictions. We explore domain adaptation transfer learning between models to address unbalanced views and a novel way to make predictions out of multi-instance embeddings. We evaluate our model's performance on subject-wise cross-validations to accurately determine performance. The experimental results show the proposed method outperforms published methods on the AX-CPT fMRI data for the prognosis problem of predicting treatment improvement in recent-onset childhood schizophrenia. To our knowledge, this is the first data-driven study of the aforementioned task on voxel-wise t-fMRI data of the whole brain.",

    "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a type of bacteria resistant to certain antibiotics, making it difficult to prevent MRSA infections. Among decades of efforts to conquer infectious diseases caused by MRSA, many studies have been proposed to estimate the causal effects of close contact (treatment) on MRSA infection (outcome) from observational data. In this problem, the treatment assignment mechanism plays a key role as it determines the patterns of missing counterfactuals --- the fundamental challenge of causal effect estimation. Most existing observational studies for causal effect learning assume that the treatment is assigned individually for each unit. However, on many occasions, the treatments are pairwisely assigned for units that are connected in graphs, i.e., the treatments of different units are entangled. Neglecting the entangled treatments can impede the causal effect estimation. In this paper, we study the problem of causal effect estimation with treatment entangled in a graph. Despite a few explorations for entangled treatments, this problem still remains challenging due to the following challenges: (1) the entanglement brings difficulties in modeling and leveraging the unknown treatment assignment mechanism; (2) there may exist hidden confounders which lead to confounding biases in causal effect estimation; (3) the observational data is often time-varying. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel method NEAT, which explicitly leverages the graph structure to model the treatment assignment mechanism, and mitigates confounding biases based on the treatment assignment modeling. We also extend our method into a dynamic setting to handle time-varying observational data. Experiments on both synthetic datasets and a real-world MRSA dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and provide insights for future applications.",

    "abstract": "Drug discovery often relies on the successful prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity. Recent advances have shown great promise in applying graph neural networks (GNNs) for better affinity prediction by learning the representations of protein-ligand complexes. However, existing solutions usually treat protein-ligand complexes as topological graph data, thus the biomolecular structural information is not fully utilized. The essential long-range interactions among atoms are also neglected in GNN models. To this end, we propose a structure-aware interactive graph neural network (SIGN) which consists of two components: polar-inspired graph attention layers (PGAL) and pairwise interactive pooling (PiPool). Specifically, PGAL iteratively performs the node-edge aggregation process to update embeddings of nodes and edges while preserving the distance and angle information among atoms. Then, PiPool is adopted to gather interactive edges with a subsequent reconstruction loss to reflect the global interactions. Exhaustive experimental study on two benchmarks verifies the superiority of SIGN.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal single-cell technologies have enabled simultaneous acquisitions of multiple omics data from the same cell, providing deeper insights into cellular states and dynamics. However, it is challenging to learn the joint representations from the multimodal data, model the relationship between modalities, and, more importantly, incorporate the vast amount of single-modality datasets into the downstream analyses. To address these challenges and correspondingly facilitate multimodal single-cell data analyses, three key tasks have been introduced: Modality prediction, Modality matching andJoint embedding. In this work, we present a general Graph Neural Network framework scMoGNN to tackle these three tasks and show that scMoGNN demonstrates superior results in all three tasks compared with the state-of-the-art and conventional approaches.

    "abstract": "Cancer remains a global challenge due to its growing clinical and economic burden. Its uniquely personal manifestation, which makes treatment difficult, has fuelled the quest for personalized treatment strategies. Thus, genomic profiling is increasingly becoming part of clinical diagnostic panels. Effective use of such panels requires accurate drug response prediction (DRP) models, which are challenging to build due to limited labelled patient data. Previous methods to address this problem have used various forms of transfer learning. However, they do not explicitly model the variable length sequential structure of the list of mutations in such diagnostic panels. Further, they do not utilize auxiliary information (like patient survival) for model training. We address these limitations through a novel transformer-based method, which surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art DRP models on benchmark data. Code for our method is available at https://github.com/CDAL-SOC/PREDICT-AI. We also present the design of a treatment recommendation system (TRS), which is currently deployed at the National University Hospital, Singapore and is being evaluated in a clinical trial. We discuss why the recommended drugs and their predicted scores alone, obtained from DRP models, are insufficient for treatment planning. Treatment planning for complex cancer cases, in the face of limited clinical validation, requires assessment of many other factors, including several indirect sources of evidence on drug efficacy. We discuss key lessons learnt on model validation and use of indirect supporting evidence to build clinicians' trust and aid their decision making.",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning has achieved great success in many sequential decision-making tasks, in which a neural agent is learned by imitating collected human demonstrations. However, existing algorithms typically require a large number of high-quality demonstrations that are difficult and expensive to collect. Usually, a trade-off needs to be made between demonstration quality and quantity in practice. Targeting this problem, in this work we consider the imitation of sub-optimal demonstrations, with both a small clean demonstration set and a large noisy set. Some pioneering works have been proposed, but they suffer from many limitations, e.g., assuming a demonstration to be of the same optimality throughout time steps and failing to provide any interpretation w.r.t knowledge learned from the noisy set. Addressing these problems, we propose \\method by evaluating and imitating at the sub-demonstration level, encoding action primitives of varying quality into different skills. Concretely, SDIL consists of a high-level controller to discover skills and a skill-conditioned module to capture action-taking policies, and is trained following a two-phase pipeline by first discovering skills with all demonstrations and then adapting the controller to only the clean set. A mutual-information-based regularization and a dynamic sub-demonstration optimality estimator are designed to promote disentanglement in the skill space. Extensive experiments are conducted over two gym environments and a real-world healthcare dataset to demonstrate the superiority of SDIL in learning from sub-optimal demonstrations and its improved interpretability by examining learned skills.",

    "abstract": "Training graph classifiers able to distinguish between healthy brains and dysfunctional ones, can help identifying substructures associated to specific cognitive phenotypes. However, the mere predictive power of the graph classifier is of limited interest to the neuroscientists, which have plenty of tools for the diagnosis of specific mental disorders. What matters is the interpretation of the model, as it can provide novel insights and new hypotheses. In this paper we propose counterfactual graphs as a way to produce local post-hoc explanations of any black-box graph classifier. Given a graph and a black-box, a counterfactual is a graph which, while having high structural similarity with the original graph, is classified by the black-box in a different class. We propose and empirically compare several strategies for counterfactual graph search. Our experiments against a white-box classifier with known optimal counterfactual, show that our methods, although heuristic, can produce counterfactuals very close to the optimal one. Finally, we show how to use counterfactual graphs to build global explanations correctly capturing the behaviour of different black-box classifiers and providing interesting insights for the neuroscientists.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of unhealthy eating habits has become a growing concern in the United States. However, popular food recommendation platforms, such as Yelp, tend to prioritize users' dietary preferences over the healthiness of their choices. While some efforts have focused on developing health-aware food recommendation systems, personalization based on specific health conditions remains underexplored. Additionally, the lack of interpretability in these systems prevents users from evaluating the reliability of recommendations, limiting their practical adoption. To address these issues, we introduce two large-scalepersonalizedhealth-aware food recommendation benchmarksat the first attempt. Building on this, we propose a novel framework called theMulti-ObjectivePersonalizedInterpretableHealth-awareFoodRecommendationSystem (MOPI-HFRS). This system generates food recommendations by jointly optimizing three objectives: user preference, personalized healthiness, and nutritional diversity. It also incorporates a reasoning module enhanced by large language models (LLMs) to provide interpretable recommendations that promote healthy dietary knowledge. The framework integrates descriptive features and health data using two structure learning and pooling modules within a graph learning framework. Pareto optimization is applied to balance the multi-faceted objectives. To further enhance healthy dietary knowledge, the system leverages LLMs by infusing knowledge from the recommendation model, generating meaningful interpretations for the recommendations. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate that MOPI-HFRS outperforms state-of-the-art methods by delivering diverse, healthy food recommendations alongside reliable explanations.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing the health status of patients based on Electronic Health Records (EHR) is a fundamental research problem in medical informatics. The presence of extensive missing values in EHR makes it challenging for deep neural networks (DNNs) to directly model the patient's health status. Existing DNNs training protocols, includingImpute-then-Regress ProcedureandJointly Optimizing of Impute-n-Regress Procedure,require the additional imputation models to reconstruction missing values. However,Impute-then-Regress Procedureintroduces the risk of injecting imputed, non-real data into downstream clinical prediction tasks, resulting in power loss, biased estimation, and poorly performing models, whileJointly Optimizing of Impute-n-Regress Procedureis also difficult to generalize due to the complex optimization space and demanding data requirements. Inspired by the recent advanced literature of learnable prompt in the fields of NLP and CV, in this work, we rethought the necessity of the imputation model in downstream clinical tasks, and proposed Learnable Prompt as Pseudo-Imputation (PAI) as a new training protocol to assist EHR analysis. PAI no longer introduces any imputed data but constructs a learnable prompt to model the implicit preferences of the downstream model for missing values, resulting in a significant performance improvement forall state-of-the-arts EHR analysis modelson four real-world datasets across two clinical prediction tasks. Further experimental analysis indicates that PAI exhibits higher robustness in situations of data insufficiency and high missing rates.

    "abstract": "Graph metric learning methods aim to learn the distance metric over graphs such that similar (e.g., same class) graphs are closer and dissimilar (e.g., different class) graphs are farther apart. This is of critical importance in many graph classification applications such as drug discovery and epidemics categorization. Most, if not all, graph metric learning techniques consider the input graph as static, and largely ignore the intrinsic dynamics of temporal graphs. However, in practice, a graph typically has heterogeneous dynamics (e.g., microscopic and macroscopic evolution patterns). As such, labeling a temporal graph is usually expensive and also requires background knowledge. To learn a good metric over temporal graphs, we propose a temporal graph metric learning framework, Temp-GFSM. With only a few labeled temporal graphs, Temp-GFSM outputs a good metric that can accurately classify different temporal graphs and be adapted to discover new subspaces for unseen classes. Each proposed component in Temp-GFSM answers the following questions: What patterns are evolving in a temporal graph? How to weigh these patterns to represent the characteristics of different temporal classes? And how to learn the metric with the guidance from only a few labels? Finally, the experimental results on real-world temporal graph classification tasks from various domains show the effectiveness of our Temp-GFSM.",

    "abstract": "Missing data is common in applied data science, particularly for tabular data sets found in healthcare, social sciences, and natural sciences. Most supervised learning methods only work on complete data, thus requiring preprocessing such as missing value imputation to work on incomplete data sets. However, imputation alone does not encode useful information about the missing values themselves. For data sets with informative missing patterns, the Missing Indicator Method (MIM), which adds indicator variables to indicate the missing pattern, can be used in conjunction with imputation to improve model performance. While commonly used in data science, MIM is surprisingly understudied from an empirical and especially theoretical perspective. In this paper, we show empirically and theoretically that MIM improves performance for informative missing values, and we prove that MIM does not hurt linear models asymptotically for uninformative missing values. Additionally, we find that for high-dimensional data sets with many uninformative indicators, MIM can induce model overfitting and thus test performance. To address this issue, we introduce Selective MIM (SMIM), a novel MIM extension that adds missing indicators only for features that have informative missing patterns. We show empirically that SMIM performs at least as well as MIM in general, and improves MIM for high-dimensional data. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of MIM on real-world data science tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MIM and SMIM on clinical tasks generated from the MIMIC-III database of electronic health records.",

    "abstract": "Physiological signals serve as indispensable clues for understanding various physiological states of human bodies. Most existing works have focused on a single type of physiological signals for a range of application scenarios. However, as the body is a holistic biological system, the inherent interconnection among various physiological data should not be neglected. In particular, given the brain's role as the control center for vital activities,electroencephalogram(EEG) exhibits significant correlations with other physiological signals. Therefore, the correlation between EEG and other physiological signals holds potential to improve performance in various scenarios. Nevertheless, achieving this goal is still constrained by several challenges: the scarcity of simultaneously collected physiological data, the differences in correlations between various signals, and the correlation differences between various tasks. To address these issues, we propose a unified physiological signal alignment framework,Brant-X, to model the correlation between EEG and other signals. Our approach (1) employs the EEG foundation model to data-efficiently transfer the rich knowledge in EEG to other physiological signals, and (2) introduces thetwo-level alignmentto fully align the semantics of EEG and other signals from different semantic scales. In the experiments,Brant-Xachieves state-of-the-art performance compared with task-agnostic and task-specific baselines on various downstream tasks in diverse scenarios, including sleep stage classification, emotion recognition,freezing of gaitsdetection, and eye movement communication. Moreover, the analysis on the arrhythmia detection task and the visualization in case study further illustrate the effectiveness ofBrant-Xin the knowledge transfer from EEG to other physiological signals.

However, previous studies mainly focus on peptide sequence attributes and do not consider crucial structure information. In this paper, we propose a latent sequence-structure model for designing AMPs (LSSAMP). LSSAMP exploits multi-scale vector quantization in the latent space to represent secondary structures (e.g. alpha helix and beta sheet). By sampling in the latent space, LSSAMP can simultaneously generate peptides with ideal sequence attributes and secondary structures. Experimental results show that the peptides generated by LSSAMP have a high probability of antimicrobial activity. Our wet laboratory experiments verified that two of the 21 candidates exhibit strong antimicrobial activity. The code is released at https://github.com/dqwang122/LSSAMP.",

    "abstract": "Efforts into understanding neurological differences between populations is an active area of research. Deep learning has recently shown promising results using EEG as input to distinguish recordings of subjects based on neurological activity. However, only about one quarter of these studies investigate the underlying neurophysiological implications. This work proposes and validates a method to investigate frequency bands important to EEG-driven deep learning models. Easy perturbation EEG algorithm for spectral importance (easyPEASI) is simpler than previous methods and requires only perturbations to input data. We validate easyPEASI on EEG pathology classification using the Temple University Health EEG Corpus. easyPEASI is further applied to characterize the effects of patients' medications on brain rhythms. We investigate classifications of patients taking one of two anticonvulsant medications, Dilantin (phenytoin) and Keppra (levetiracetam), and subjects taking no medications. We find that for recordings of subjects with clinically-determined normal EEG that these medications effect the Theta and Alpha band most significantly. For recordings with clinically-determined abnormal EEG these medications affected the Delta, Theta, and Alpha bands most significantly. We also find the Beta band to be affected differently by the two medications. Results found here show promise for a method of obtaining explainable artificial intelligence and interpretable models from EEG-driven deep learning through a simpler more accessible method perturbing only input data. Overall, this work provides a fast, easy, and reproducible method to automatically determine salient spectral features of neural activity that have been learned by machine learning models, such as deep learning.",

    "abstract": "Attention-based image classification has gained increasing popularity in recent years. State-of-the-art methods for attention-based classification typically require a large training set and operate under the assumption that the label of an image depends solely on a single object (i.e. region of interest) in the image. However, in many real-world applications (e.g. medical imaging), it is very expensive to collect a large training set. Moreover, the label of each image is usually determined jointly by multiple regions of interest (ROIs). Fortunately, for such applications, it is often possible to collect the locations of the ROIs in each training image. In this paper, we study the problem of guided multi-attention classification, the goal of which is to achieve high accuracy under the dual constraints of (1) small sample size, and (2) multiple ROIs for each image. We propose a model, called Guided Attention Recurrent Network (GARN), for multi-attention classification. Different from existing attention-based methods, GARN utilizes guidance information regarding multiple ROIs thus allowing it to work well even when sample size is small. Empirical studies on three different visual tasks show that our guided attention approach can effectively boost model performance for multi-attention image classification.",

    "abstract": "Synthesizing electronic health records (EHR) data has become a preferred strategy to address data scarcity, improve data quality, and model fairness in healthcare. However, existing approaches for EHR data generation predominantly rely on state-of-the-art generative techniques like generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, and language models. These methods typically replicate input visits, resulting in inadequate modeling of temporal dependencies between visits and overlooking the generation of time information, a crucial element in EHR data. Moreover, their ability to learn visit representations is limited due to simple linear mapping functions, thus compromising generation quality. To address these limitations, we propose a novel EHR data generation model called EHRPD. It is a diffusion-based model designed to predict the next visit based on the current one while also incorporating time interval estimation. To enhance generation quality and diversity, we introduce a novel time-aware visit embedding module and a pioneering predictive denoising diffusion probabilistic model (P-DDPM). Additionally, we devise a predictive U-Net (PU-Net) to optimize P-DDPM. We conduct experiments on two public datasets and evaluate EHRPD from fidelity, privacy, and utility perspectives. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and utility of the proposed EHRPD in addressing the aforementioned limitations and advancing EHR data generation.",

AntAkso incorporates a digital and professional management system, achieving a notable decrease in the volume of false claims, reduction in administrative costs, and heightened satisfaction among its policyholders. We begin by highlighting the core components of this system, including the case stratification, hospital recommendation, and case dispatch modules, along with the pivotal algorithms employed, i.e., the fraud detection, recommendation, and robust satisficing algorithms.

    "abstract": "To manage the COVID-19 epidemic effectively, decision-makers in public health need accurate forecasts of case numbers. A potential near real-time predictor of future case numbers is human mobility; however, research on the predictive power of mobility is lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel model for epidemic forecasting based on mobility data, called mobility marked Hawkes model. The proposed model consists of three components: (1) A Hawkes process captures the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. (2) A mark modulates the rate of infections, thus accounting for how the reproduction number R varies across space and time. The mark is modeled using a regularized Poisson regression based on mobility covariates. (3) A correction procedure incorporates new cases seeded by people traveling between regions. Our model was evaluated on the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. Specifically, we used mobility data from February through April 2020, amounting to approximately 1.5 billion trips. Trip counts were derived from large-scale telecommunication data, i.e., cell phone pings from the Swisscom network, the largest telecommunication provider in Switzerland. We compared our model against various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of out-of-sample root mean squared error. We found that our model outperformed the baselines by 15.52%. The improvement was consistently achieved across different forecast horizons between 5 and 21 days. In addition, we assessed the predictive power of conventional point of interest data, confirming that telecommunication data is superior. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to predict the spread of COVID-19 from telecommunication data. Altogether, our work contributes to previous research by developing a scalable early warning system for decision-makers in public health tasked with controlling the spread of infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Brain signals are important quantitative data for understanding physiological activities and diseases of human brain. Meanwhile, rapidly developing deep learning methods offer a wide range of opportunities for better modeling brain signals, which has attracted considerable research efforts recently. Most existing studies pay attention to supervised learning methods, which, however, require high-cost clinical labels. In addition, the huge difference in the clinical patterns of brain signals measured by invasive (e.g., SEEG) and non-invasive (e.g., EEG) methods leads to the lack of a unified method. To handle the above issues, in this paper, we propose to study the self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for brain signals that can be applied to pre-train either SEEG or EEG data. Intuitively, brain signals, generated by the firing of neurons, are transmitted among different connecting structures in human brain. Inspired by this, we propose MBrain to learn implicit spatial and temporal correlations between different channels (i.e., contacts of the electrode, corresponding to different brain areas) as the cornerstone for uniformly modeling different types of brain signals. Specifically, we represent the spatial correlation by a graph structure, which is built with proposed multi-channel CPC. We theoretically prove that optimizing the goal of multi-channel CPC can lead to a better predictive representation and apply the instantaneou-time-shift prediction task based on it. Then we capture the temporal correlation by designing the delayed-time-shift prediction task. Finally, replace-discriminative-learning task is proposed to preserve the characteristics of each channel. Extensive experiments of seizure detection on both EEG and SEEG large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art time series SSL and unsupervised models, and has the ability to be deployed to clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Rationale is defined as a subset of input features that best explains or supports the prediction by machine learning models. Rationale identification has improved the generalizability and interpretability of neural networks on vision and language data. In graph applications such as molecule and polymer property prediction, identifying representative subgraph structures named as graph rationales plays an essential role in the performance of graph neural networks. Existing graph pooling and/or distribution intervention methods suffer from the lack of examples to learn to identify optimal graph rationales. In this work, we introduce a new augmentation operation called environment replacement that automatically creates virtual data examples to improve rationale identification. We propose an efficient framework that performs rationale-environment separation and representation learning on the real and augmented examples in latent spaces to avoid the high complexity of explicit graph decoding and encoding. Comparing against recent techniques, experiments on seven molecular and four polymer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed augmentation-based graph rationalization framework.

    "abstract": "To control the outbreak of COVID-19, efficient individual mobility intervention for EPidemic Control (EPC) strategies are of great importance, which cut off the contact among people at epidemic risks and reduce infections by intervening the mobility of individuals. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is powerful for decision making, however, there are two major challenges in developing an RL-based EPC strategy: (1) the unobservable information about asymptomatic infections in the incubation period makes it difficult for RL's decision-making, and (2) the delayed rewards for RL causes the deficiency of RL learning. Since the results of EPC are reflected in both daily infections (including unobservable asymptomatic infections) and long-term cumulative cases of COVID-19, it is quite daunting to design an RL model for precise mobility intervention. In this paper, we propose a Variational hiErarcHICal reinforcement Learning method for Epidemic control via individual-level mobility intervention, namely Vehicle. To tackle the above challenges, Vehicle first exploits an information rebuilding module that consists of a contact-risk bipartite graph neural network and a variational LSTM to restore the unobservable information. The contact-risk bipartite graph neural network estimates the possibility of an individual being an asymptomatic infection and the risk of this individual spreading the epidemic, as the current state of RL. Then, the Variational LSTM further encodes the state sequence to model the latency of epidemic spreading caused by unobservable asymptomatic infections. Finally, a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework is employed to train Vehicle, which contains dual-level agents to solve the delayed reward problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Vehicle can effectively control the spread of the epidemic. Vehicle outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods with remarkably high-precision mobility interventions on both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a commonly diagnosed movement disorder with more than 10 million patients worldwide. Its clinical evaluation relies on a rating system called MDS-UPDRS, which includes subjective and error-prone motor examinations. This paper proposes an objective and interpretable visual system (PD-Net ) to quantitatively evaluate motor function of PD patients using video footage. The PD-Net consists of three modules: 1) a pose detector to infer 21 hand keypoints directly from RGB videos, 2) a movement analysis module to study temporal patterns of hand keypoints and discover motor symptoms, and 3) a scoring module to predict MDS-UPDRS ratings with retrieved symptoms. Trained with an in-house clinical dataset, PD-Net can effectively handle the unique challenges of PD examination videos, such as clinically-defined gestures, distinct self-occlusion/foreshortening effect and contextual background. And it detects hand keypoints of PD patients with an average accuracy of 84.1%, a 32.9% improvement over OpenPose. When compared to the ratings of experienced clinicians, PD-Net achieves an overall MDS-UPDRS rating score accuracy of 87.6% and Cohen's kappa of 0.82 on a testing dataset of 509 examination videos at a level exceeding human raters. This study demonstrates a clinically applicable automated video analysis system for PD clinical evaluation, which can facilitate early detection, routine monitoring, and treatment assessment.",

    "abstract": "In causal inference, estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) is critical for identifying how different subgroups respond to interventions, with broad applications in fields such as precision medicine and personalized advertising. Although HTE estimation methods aim to improve accuracy, how to provide explicit subgroup descriptions remains unclear, hindering data interpretation and strategic intervention management. In this paper, we proposeCURLS, a novel rule learning method leveraging HTE, which can effectively describe subgroups with significant treatment effects. Specifically, we frame causal rule learning as a discrete optimization problem, finely balancing treatment effect with variance and considering the rule interpretability. We design an iterative procedure based on the minorize-maximization algorithm and solve a submodular lower bound as an approximation for the original. Quantitative experiments and qualitative case studies verify that compared with state-of-the-art methods,CURLScan find subgroups where the estimated and true effects are 16.1% and 13.8% higher and the variance is 12.0% smaller, while maintaining similar or better estimation accuracy and rule interpretability.

    "abstract": "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations provide a blueprint of a better future by \"leaving no one behind\", and, to achieve the SDGs by 2030, poor countries require immense volumes of development aid. In this paper, we develop a causal machine learning framework for predicting heterogeneous treatment effects of aid disbursements to inform effective aid allocation. Specifically, our framework comprises three components: (i) a balancing autoencoder that uses representation learning to embed high-dimensional country characteristics while addressing treatment selection bias; (ii) a counterfactual generator to compute counterfactual outcomes for varying aid volumes to address small sample-size settings; and (iii) an inference model that is used to predict heterogeneous treatment-response curves. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using data with official development aid earmarked to end HIV/AIDS in 105 countries, amounting to more than USD 5.2 billion. For this, we first show that our framework successfully computes heterogeneous treatment-response curves using semi-synthetic data. Then, we demonstrate our framework using real-world HIV data. Our framework points to large opportunities for a more effective aid allocation, suggesting that the total number of new HIV infections could be reduced by up to 3.3% (~50,000 cases) compared to the current allocation practice.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, emergency last-mile logistics (ELML) have played an essential role in urban emergencies. The efficient allocation of couriers in ELML is of practical significance to ensure the supply of essential materials, especially in public health emergencies (PHEs). However, couriers allocation becomes challenging due to the instability of demand, dynamic supply comprehension, and the evolutional delivery environment for ELML caused by PHEs. While existing work has delved into couriers allocation, the impact of PHEs on demand-supply-delivery has yet to be considered. In this work, we design PTOCA, a Predict-Then-Optimize Couriers Allocation framework. Specifically, in the prediction stage, we design a resource-aware prediction module that performs spatio-temporal modeling of unstable demand characteristics using a variational graph GRU encoder and builds a task-resource regressor to predict demand accurately. In the optimization stage, firstly, the priority ranking module solves the matching of delivery resources under demand-supply imbalance. Then the multi-factor task allocation module is used to model the dynamic evolutional environment and reasonably assign the delivery tasks of couriers. We evaluate PTOCA using real-world data covering 170 delivery zones, more than 10,000 couriers, and 100 million delivery tasks. The data is collected from JD Logistics, one of the largest logistics service companies. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms the baseline in task delivery rate and on-time delivery rate.",

    "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful way to understand data that can naturally be represented by a graph structure. Furthermore, in many domains, it is highly desirable to derive data-driven global explanations or rules that can better explain the high-level properties of the models and data in question. However, evaluating global counterfactual explanations is hard in real-world datasets due to a lack of human-annotated ground truth, which limits their use in areas like molecular sciences. Additionally, the increasing scale of these datasets provides a challenge for random search-based methods. In this paper, we develop a novel global explanation model RLHEX for molecular property prediction. It aligns the counterfactual explanations with human-defined principles, making the explanations more interpretable and easy for experts to evaluate. RLHEX includes a VAE-based graph generator to generate global explanations and an adapter to adjust the latent representation space to human-defined principles. Optimized by Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the global explanations produced by RLHEX cover 4.12% more input graphs and reduce the distance between the counterfactual explanation set and the input set by 0.47% on average across three molecular datasets. RLHEX provides a flexible framework to incorporate different human-designed principles into the counterfactual explanation generation process, aligning these explanations with domain expertise.

    "abstract": "We consider the explanation of 3D graph neural networks (GNNs) in the field of molecular learning. Recent studies have modeled molecules as 3D graphs, but there exist formidable challenges for 3D graph explanation. In this work, we propose a novel and principled paradigm, known as 3DGraphX, for 3D molecular graph explanation. Unlike existing 2D GNN explanation methods, 3DGraphX focuses on 3D motifs, which are subgraphs showing great occurrence and function significance in molecular activities. Once generated, 3D motifs are fixed in the explanation model; hence, 3DGraphX produces more accurate and chemically plausible explanations in an efficient manner. 3DGraphX contains two branches with several novel methods for instance-level and geometry-level explanations, respectively. Two novel components, known as the mask pooling component and mask unpooling component, are developed to discover important motifs for each 3D molecule as the instance-level explanation. Local spherical coordinate systems are built to investigate the relative positions among motifs for geometry-level explanation. Altogether, 3DGraphX sheds light on the characteristics of molecules as well as the behaviors of 3D GNNs in molecular learning. Experimental results show that 3DGraphX significantly outperforms baselines in instance-level explanation with various explanation budgets. Additional experiments show that 3DGraphX reveals the important geometries taken by 3D GNNs for accurate molecular learning. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/xufliu/3DGraphX.",

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting, as one of the fundamental machine learning areas, has attracted tremendous attentions over recent years. The solutions have evolved from statistical machine learning (ML) methods to deep learning techniques. One emerging sub-field of time series forecasting is individual disease progression forecasting, e.g., predicting individuals' disease development over a few days (e.g., deteriorating trends, recovery speed) based on few past observations. Despite the promises in the existing ML techniques, a variety of unique challenges emerge for disease progression forecasting, such as irregularly-sampled time series, data sparsity, and individual heterogeneity in disease progression. To tackle these challenges, we propose novel Conditional Neural Ordinary Differential Equations Processes (CNDPs), and validate it in a COVID-19 disease progression forecasting task using audio data. CNDPs allow for irregularly-sampled time series modelling, enable accurate forecasting with sparse past observations, and achieve individual-level progression forecasting. CNDPs show strong performance with an Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) of 78.1%, outperforming a variety of commonly used Recurrent Neural Networks based models. With the proposed label-enhancing mechanism (i.e., including the initial health status as input) and the customised individual-level loss, CNDPs further boost the performance reaching a UAR of 93.6%. Additional analysis also reveals the model's capability in tracking individual-specific recovery trend, implying the potential usage of the model for remote disease progression monitoring. In general, CNDPs pave new pathways for time series forecasting, and provide considerable advantages for disease progression monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Medical ontologies are widely used to represent and organize medical terminologies. Examples include ICD-9, ICD-10, UMLS etc. The ontologies are often constructed in hierarchical structures, encoding the multi-level subclass relationships among different medical concepts, allowing very fine distinctions between concepts. Medical ontologies provide a great source for incorporating domain knowledge into a healthcare prediction system, which might alleviate the data insufficiency problem and improve predictive performance with rare categories. To incorporate such domain knowledge, Gram, a recent graph attention model, represents a medical concept as a weighted sum of its ancestors' embeddings in the ontology using an attention mechanism. Although showing improved performance, Gram only considers the unordered ancestors of a concept, which does not fully leverage the hierarchy thus having limited expressibility. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Attention Propagation (HAP), a novel medical ontology embedding model that hierarchically propagate attention across the entire ontology structure, where a medical concept adaptively learns its embedding from all other concepts in the hierarchy instead of only its ancestors. We prove that HAP learns more expressive medical concept embeddings -- from any medical concept embedding we are able to fully recover the entire ontology structure. Experimental results on two sequential procedure/diagnosis prediction tasks demonstrate HAP's better embedding quality than Gram and other baselines. Furthermore, we find that it is not always best to use the full ontology. Sometimes using only lower levels of the hierarchy outperforms using all levels.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning methods have been widely used in modern electronic health record (EHR) systems, and have shown more accurate prediction performance on disease risk assessment tasks than traditional methods. However, most of the existing machine learning methods make the assessment solely based on features of the target case but ignore the cross-sample feature interactions between the target case and other similar cases, which is inconsistent with the general practice of evidence-based medicine of making diagnoses based on existing clinical experience. Moreover, current methods that focus on mining cross-sample information rely on deep neural networks to extract cross-sample feature interactions, which would suffer from the problems of data insufficiency, data heterogeneity and lack of interpretability in disease risk assessment tasks. In this work, we propose a novel retrieval-based gradient boosting decision trees (RB-GBDT) model with a cross-sample extractor to mine cross-sample information while exploiting the superiority of GBDT of robustness, generalization and interpretability. Experiments on real-world clinical datasets show the superiority and efficacy of RB-GBDT on disease risk assessment tasks.

    "abstract": "Existing tensor completion formulation mostly relies on partial observations from a single tensor. However, tensors extracted from real-world data often are more complex due to: (i) Partial observation: Only a small subset of tensor elements are available. (ii) Coarse observation: Some tensor modes only present coarse and aggregated patterns (e.g., monthly summary instead of daily reports). In this paper, we are given a subset of the tensor and some aggregated/coarse observations (along one or more modes) and seek to recover the original fine-granular tensor with low-rank factorization. We formulate a coupled tensor completion problem and propose an efficient Multi-resolution Tensor Completion model (MTC) to solve the problem. Our MTC model explores tensor mode properties and leverages the hierarchy of resolutions to recursively initialize an optimization setup, and optimizes on the coupled system using alternating least squares. MTC ensures low computational and space complexity. We evaluate our model on two COVID-19 related spatio-temporal tensors. The experiments show that MTC could provide 65.20% and 75.79% percentage of fitness (PoF) in tensor completion with only 5% fine granular observations, which is 27.96% relative improvement over the best baseline. To evaluate the learned low-rank factors, we also design a tensor prediction task for daily and cumulative disease case predictions, where MTC achieves 50% in PoF and 30% relative improvements over the best baseline.",

    "abstract": "Survival analysis, aka time-to-event analysis, has a wide-ranging impact on patient care. Federated Survival Analysis (FSA) is an emerging Federated Learning (FL) paradigm for performing survival analysis on distributed decentralized data available at multiple medical institutions. FSA enables individual medical institutions, referred to as clients, to improve their survival predictions while ensuring privacy. However, FSA faces challenges due to non-linear and non-IID data distributions among clients, as well as bias caused by censoring. Although recent studies have adapted Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) survival models for FSA, a systematic exploration of these challenges is currently lacking. In this paper, we address these critical challenges by introducing FedPseudo, a pseudo value-based deep learning framework for FSA. FedPseudo uses deep learning models to learn robust representations from non-linear survival data, leverages the power of pseudo values to handle non-uniform censoring, and employs FL algorithms such as FedAvg to learn model parameters. We propose a novel and simple approach for estimating pseudo values for FSA. We provide theoretical proof that the estimated pseudo values, referred to as Federated Pseudo Values, are consistent. Moreover, our empirical results demonstrate that they can be computed faster than traditional methods of deriving pseudo values. To ensure and enhance the privacy of both the estimated pseudo values and the shared model parameters, we systematically investigate the application of differential privacy (DP) on both the federated pseudo values and local model updates. Furthermore, we adapt V -Usable Information metric to quantify the informativeness of a client's data for training a survival model and utilize this metric to show the advantages of participating in FSA. We conducted extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world survival datasets to demonstrate that our FedPseudo framework achieves better performance than other FSA approaches and performs similarly to the best centrally trained deep survival model. Moreover, FedPseudo consistently achieves superior results across different censoring settings.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a new graph learning problem: learning to count subgraph isomorphisms. Different from other traditional graph learning problems such as node classification and link prediction, subgraph isomorphism counting is NP-complete and requires more global inference to oversee the whole graph. To make it scalable for large-scale graphs and patterns, we propose a learning framework that augments different representation learning architectures and iteratively attends pattern and target data graphs to memorize intermediate states of subgraph isomorphism searching for global counting. We develop both small graphs (<= 1,024 subgraph isomorphisms in each) and large graphs (<= 4,096 subgraph isomorphisms in each) sets to evaluate different representation and interaction modules. A mutagenic compound dataset, MUTAG, is also used to evaluate neural models and demonstrate the success of transfer learning. While the learning based approach is inexact, we are able to generalize to count large patterns and data graphs in linear time compared to the exponential time of the original NP-complete problem. Experimental results show that learning based subgraph isomorphism counting can speed up the traditional algorithm, VF2, 10-1,000 times with acceptable errors. Domain adaptation based on fine-tuning also shows the usefulness of our approach in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of sparse nonlinear model recovery of high dimensional compositional functions. Our study is motivated by emerging opportunities in neuroscience to recover fine-grained models of biological neural circuits using collected measurement data. Guided by available domain knowledge in neuroscience, we explore conditions under which one can recover the underlying biological circuit that generated the training data. Our results suggest insights of both theoretical and practical interests. Most notably, we find that a sign constraint on the weights is a necessary condition for system recovery, which we establish both theoretically with an identifiability guarantee and empirically on simulated biological circuits. We conclude with a case study on retinal ganglion cell circuits using data collected from mouse retina, showcasing the practical potential of this approach.",

    "abstract": "In cross-silo federated learning (FL), the data among clients are usually statistically heterogeneous (aka not independent and identically distributed, non-IID) due to diversified data sources, lowering the accuracy of FL. Although many personalized FL (PFL) approaches have been proposed to address this issue, they are only suitable for data with specific degrees of statistical heterogeneity. In the real world, the heterogeneity of data among clients is often immeasurable due to privacy concern, making the targeted selection of PFL approaches difficult. Besides, in cross-silo FL, clients are usually from different organizations, tending to hold architecturally different private models. In this work, we propose a novel FL framework, FedAPEN, which combines mutual learning and ensemble learning to take the advantages of private and shared global models while allowing heterogeneous models. Within FedAPEN, we propose two mechanisms to coordinate and promote model ensemble such that FedAPEN achieves excellent accuracy on various data distributions without prior knowledge of data heterogeneity, and thus, obtains the adaptability to data heterogeneity. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, including: 1) Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, each with ten different types and degrees of label distribution skew; and 2) eICU with feature distribution skew. The experiments demonstrate that FedAPEN almost obtains superior accuracy on data with varying types and degrees of heterogeneity compared with baselines.",

With novel interaction techniques, our tool puts interpretability into action-empowering users to analyze, validate, and align model behaviors with their knowledge and values. Physicians have started to use our tool to investigate and fix pneumonia and sepsis risk prediction models, and an evaluation with 7 data scientists working in diverse domains highlights that our tool is easy to use, meets their model editing needs, and fits into their current workflows. Built with modern web technologies, our tool runs locally in users' web browsers or computational notebooks, lowering the barrier to use.

    "abstract": "Causal effect estimation (CEE) provides a crucial tool for predicting the unobserved counterfactual outcome for an entity. As CEE relaxes the requirement for \"perfect'' counterfactual samples (e.g., patients with identical attributes and only differ in treatments received) that are impractical to obtain and can instead operate on observational data, it is usually used in high-stake domains like medical treatment effect prediction. Nevertheless, in those high-stake domains, gathering a decently sized, fully labelled observational dataset remains challenging due to hurdles associated with costs, ethics, expertise and time needed, etc., of which medical treatment surveys are a typical example. Consequently, if the training dataset is small in scale, low generalization risks can hardly be achieved on any CEE algorithms. Unlike existing CEE methods that assume the constant availability of a dataset with abundant samples, in this paper, we study a more realistic CEE setting where the labelled data samples are scarce at the beginning, while more can be gradually acquired over the course of training -- assuredly under a limited budget considering their expensive nature. Then, the problem naturally comes down to actively selecting the best possible samples to be labelled, e.g., identifying the next subset of patients to conduct the treatment survey. However, acquiring quality data for reducing the CEE risk under limited labelling budgets remains under-explored until now. To fill the gap, we theoretically analyse the generalization risk from an intriguing perspective of progressively shrinking its upper bound, and develop a principled label acquisition pipeline exclusively for CEE tasks. With our analysis, we propose the Model Agnostic Causal Active Learning (MACAL) algorithm for batch-wise label acquisition, which aims to reduce both the CEE model's uncertainty and the post-acquisition distributional imbalance simultaneously at each acquisition step. Extensive experiments are conducted on three datasets, where a clear empirical performance gain from MACAL is observed over state-of-the-art active learning baselines. The implementation repository is open-sourced at: https://github.com/uqhwen2/MACAL.",

    "abstract": "Survival analysis aims to predict the risk of an event, such as death due to cancer, in the presence of censoring. Recent research has shown that existing survival techniques are prone to unintentional biases towards protected attributes such as age, race, and/or gender. For example, censoring assumed to be unrelated to the prognosis and covariates (typically violated in real data) often leads to overestimation and biased survival predictions for different protected groups. In order to attenuate harmful bias and ensure fair survival predictions, we introduce fairness definitions based on survival functions and censoring. We propose novel fair and interpretable survival models which use pseudo valued-based objective functions with fairness definitions as constraints for predicting subject-specific survival probabilities. Experiments on three real-world survival datasets demonstrate that our proposed fair survival models show significant improvement over existing survival techniques in terms of accuracy and fairness measures. We show that our proposed models provide fair predictions for protected attributes under different types and amounts of censoring. Furthermore, we study the interplay between interpretability and fairness; and investigate how fairness and censoring impact survival predictions for different protected attributes.",

    "abstract": "In binary classification problems, many performance metrics evaluate the probability that some error exceeds a threshold. Nevertheless, they focus more on the probability and fail to capture the magnitude of the error, which evaluates how large this error exceeds the threshold. Capturing the magnitude of error is desired in many applications. For example, in detecting disease and predicting credit default, the magnitude of error illustrates the confidence in making the wrong prediction. We propose a novel metric, the Fragility Index (FI), to evaluate the performance of binary classifiers by capturing the magnitude of the error. FI alleviates the risk of misclassification by penalizing the large error greatly, which is seldom considered by standard metrics. Moreover, to strengthen the generalization ability and handle unseen samples, we adopt the framework of distributionally robust optimization and robust satisficing, which allows us to derive and control the maximum degree of fragility of the classifier when the distribution of samples shifts. We show that FI can be easily calculated and optimized for common probabilistic distance measures. Experiments with real datasets demonstrate the new insights brought by FI and the advantages of classifiers selected under FI, which always improve the robustness and reduce the risk of large errors as compared to classifiers selected by alternative metrics.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, sequential learning has been of great interest due to the advance of deep learning with applications in time-series forecasting, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have achieved superior performance in single-view and synchronous multi-view sequential learning comparing to traditional machine learning models. However, the method remains less explored in asynchronous multi-view sequential learning, and the unalignment nature of multiple sequences poses a great challenge to learn the inter-view interactions. We develop an AMANet (Attention and Memory-Augmented Networks) architecture by integrating both attention and memory to solve asynchronous multi-view learning problem in general, and we focus on experiments in dual-view sequences in this paper. Self-attention and inter-attention are employed to capture intra-view interaction and inter-view interaction, respectively. History attention memory is designed to store the historical information of a specific object, which serves as local knowledge storage. Dynamic external memory is used to store global knowledge for each view. We evaluate our model in three tasks: medication recommendation from a patient's medical records, diagnosis-related group (DRG) classification from a hospital record, and invoice fraud detection through a company's taxation behaviors. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms all baselines and other state-of-the-art models in all tasks. Moreover, the ablation study of our model indicates that the inter-attention mechanism plays a key role in the model and it can boost the predictive power by effectively capturing the inter-view interactions from asynchronous views.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks can leverage self-supervision to learn integrated representations across multiple data modalities. This makes them suitable to uncover complex relationships between vastly different data types, thus lowering the dependency on labor-intensive feature engineering methods. Leveraging deep representation learning, we propose a generic, robust and systematic model that is able to combine multiple data modalities in a permutation and modes-number-invariant fashion, both fundamental properties to properly face changes in data type content and availability. To this end, we treat each multi-modal data sample as a set and utilise autoencoders to learn a fixed size, permutation invariant representation that can be used in any decision making process. We build upon previous work that demonstrates the feasibility of presenting a set as an input to autoencoders through content-based attention mechanisms. However, since model inputs and outputs are permutation invariant, we develop an end-to-end architecture that approximates the solution of a linear sum assignment problem, i.e., a minimum-cost bijective mapping problem, to ensure a match between the elements of the input and the output set for effective loss calculation. We demonstrate the model capability to learn a combined representation while preserving individual mode characteristics focusing on the task of reconstructing multi-omic cancer data.

    "abstract": "Pseudo-cliques (subgraphs with almost all possible edges) have many applications. But they do not satisfy the convertible antimonotone constraint (as we prove here). So, it is hard to reduce the search space of pseudo-cliques and list them efficiently. To our knowledge, only two exact algorithms, namely, ODES and PCE, were proposed for this purpose, but both have high execution times. Here, we present an exact algorithm namedFast Pseudo-Clique Enumerator (FPCE). It employs some pruning techniques we derived to reduce the search space. Our experiment on 15 real and 16 synthetic graphs shows that (i) on real graphs, FPCE is, on average, 38.6 and 6.5 times faster than ODES and PCE, respectively, whereas (ii) on synthetic graphs, FPCE is, on average, 39.7 and 3.1 times faster than ODES and PCE, respectively. We apply FPCE and a popular heuristic method on a PPI network to identify pseudo-cliques. FPCE outputs match with more known protein complexes, are more accurate, and are biologically more significant - suggesting that the exact computation of pseudo-cliques may give better insights. For its speed, FPCE is a suitable choice in such cases.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental task in causal inference is estimating the effect of adistributionshift in the treatment variable. We refer to this problem asshift-response function(SRF) estimation. Existing neural network methods for causal inference lack theoretical guarantees and practical implementations for SRF estimation. In this paper, we introduce Targeted Regularization for Exposure Shifts with Neural Networks (TRESNET), a method to estimate SRFs with robustness and efficiency guarantees. Our contributions are twofold. First, we propose a targeted regularization loss for neural networks with theoretical properties that ensure double robustness and asymptotic efficiency specific to SRF estimation. Second, we extend targeted regularization to support loss functions from the exponential family to accommodate non-continuous outcome distributions (e.g., discrete counts). We conduct benchmark experiments demonstrating TRESNET's broad applicability and competitiveness. We then apply our method to a key policy question in public health to estimate the causal effect of revising the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM2.5from 12 μg/m3to 9 μg/m3. This change has been recently proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Our goal is to estimate the reduction in deaths that would result from this anticipated revision using data consisting of 68 million individuals across the U.S.",

    "abstract": "Despite intense efforts in basic and clinical research, an individualized ventilation strategy for critically ill patients remains a major challenge. Recently, dynamic treatment regime (DTR) with reinforcement learning (RL) on electronic health records (EHR) has attracted interest from both the healthcare industry and machine learning research community. However, most learned DTR policies might be biased due to the existence of confounders. Although some treatment actions non-survivors received may be helpful, if confounders cause the mortality, the training of RL models guided by long-term outcomes (e.g., 90-day mortality) would punish those treatment actions causing the learned DTR policies to be suboptimal. In this study, we develop a new deconfounding actor-critic network (DAC) to learn optimal DTR policies for patients. To alleviate confounding issues, we incorporate a patient resampling module and a confounding balance module into our actor-critic framework. To avoid punishing the effective treatment actions non-survivors received, we design a short-term reward to capture patients' immediate health state changes. Combining short-term with long-term rewards could further improve the model performance. Moreover, we introduce a policy adaptation method to successfully transfer the learned model to new-source small-scale datasets. The experimental results on one semi-synthetic and two different real-world datasets show the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models. The proposed model provides individualized treatment decisions for mechanical ventilation that could improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Timely, high-resolution forecasts of infectious disease incidence are useful for policy makers in deciding intervention measures and estimating healthcare resource burden. In this paper, we consider the task of forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases at the county level for the United States. Although multiple methods have been explored for this task, their performance has varied across space and time due to noisy data and the inherent dynamic nature of the pandemic. We present a forecasting pipeline which incorporates probabilistic forecasts from multiple statistical, machine learning and mechanistic methods through a Bayesian ensembling scheme, and has been operational for nearly 6 months serving local, state and federal policymakers in the United States. While showing that the Bayesian ensemble is at least as good as the individual methods, we also show that each individual method contributes significantly for different spatial regions and time points. We compare our model's performance with other similar models being integrated into CDC-initiated COVID-19 Forecast Hub, and show better performance at longer forecast horizons. Finally, we also describe how such forecasts are used to increase lead time for training mechanistic scenario projections. Our work demonstrates that such a real-time high resolution forecasting pipeline can be developed by integrating multiple methods within a performance-based ensemble to support pandemic response.",

    "abstract": "We consider the setting of cascades that result from contagion dynamics on large realistic contact networks. We address the question of whether the structural properties of a (partially) observed cascade can characterize the contagion scenario and identify the interventions that might be in effect. Using epidemic spread as a concrete example, we study how social interventions such as compliance in social distancing, extent (and efficacy) of vaccination, and the transmissibility of disease can be inferred. The techniques developed are more generally applicable to other contagions as well. Our approach involves the use of large realistic social contact networks of certain regions of USA and an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate spread under two interventions, namely vaccination and generic social distancing (GSD). Through a machine learning approach, coupled with parameter significance analysis, our experimental results show that subgraph counts of the graph induced by the cascade can be used effectively to characterize the contagion scenario even during the initial stages of the epidemic, when traditional information such as case counts alone are not adequate for this task. Further, we show that our approach performs well even for partially observed cascades. These results demonstrate that cascade data collected from digital tracing applications under poor digital penetration and privacy constraints can provide valuable information about the contagion scenario.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive, debilitating neurodegenerative disease which causes motor symptoms including gait dysfunction. Motor fluctuations are alterations between periods with a positive response to levodopa therapy (\"on\") and periods marked by re-emergency of PD symptoms (\"off\") as the response to medication wears off. These fluctuations often affect gait speed and they increase in their disabling impact as PD progresses. To improve the effectiveness of current indoor localisation methods, a transformer-based approach utilising dual modalities which provide complementary views of movement, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and accelerometer data from wearable devices, is proposed. A sub-objective aims to evaluate whether indoor localisation, including its in-home gait speed features (i.e. the time taken to walk between rooms), could be used to evaluate motor fluctuations by detecting whether the person with PD is taking levodopa medications or withholding them. To properly evaluate our proposed method, we use a free-living dataset where the movements and mobility are greatly varied and unstructured as expected in real-world conditions. 24 participants lived in pairs (consisting of one person with PD, one control) for five days in a smart home with various sensors. Our evaluation on the resulting dataset demonstrates that our proposed network outperforms other methods for indoor localisation. The sub-objective evaluation shows that precise room-level localisation predictions, transformed into in-home gait speed features, produce accurate predictions on whether the PD participant is taking or withholding their medications.",

    "abstract": "Finding an appropriate representation of dynamic activities in the brain is crucial for many downstream applications. Due to its highly dynamic nature, temporally averaged fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) can only provide a narrow view of underlying brain activities. Previous works lack the ability to learn and interpret the latent dynamics in brain architectures. This paper builds an efficient graph neural network model that incorporates both region-mapped fMRI sequences and structural connectivities obtained from DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) as inputs. We find good representations of the latent brain dynamics through learning sample-level adaptive adjacency matrices and performing a novel multi-resolution inner cluster smoothing. We also attribute inputs with integrated gradients, which enables us to infer (1) highly involved brain connections and subnetworks for each task, (2) temporal keyframes of imaging sequences that characterize tasks, and (3) subnetworks that discriminate between individual subjects. This ability to identify critical subnetworks that characterize signal states across heterogeneous tasks and individuals is of great importance to neuroscience and other scientific domains. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate our proposed method's superiority and efficiency in spatial-temporal graph signal modeling with insightful interpretations of brain dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Discovering evolutionary traits that are heritable across species on the tree of life (also referred to as a phylogenetic tree) is of great interest to biologists to understand how organisms diversify and evolve. However, the measurement of traits is often a subjective and labor-intensive process, making trait discovery a highly label-scarce problem. We present a novel approach for discovering evolutionary traits directly from images without relying on trait labels. Our proposed approach, Phylo-NN, encodes the image of an organism into a sequence of quantized feature vectors -or codes- where different segments of the sequence capture evolutionary signals at varying ancestry levels in the phylogeny. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing biologically meaningful results in a number of downstream tasks including species image generation and species-to-species image translation, using fish species as a target example",

    "abstract": "Facing the outbreak of COVID-19, shortage in medical resources becomes increasingly outstanding. Therefore, efficient strategies for medical resource allocation are urgently called for. Reinforcement learning (RL) is powerful for decision making, but three key challenges exist in solving this problem via RL: (1) complex situation and countless choices for decision making in the real world; (2) only imperfect information are available due to the latency of pandemic spreading; (3) limitations on conducting experiments in real world since we cannot set pandemic outbreaks arbitrarily. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning method with a corresponding training algorithm. We design a decomposed action space to deal with the countless choices to ensure efficient and real time strategies. We also design a recurrent neural network based framework to utilize the imperfect information obtained from the environment. We build a pandemic spreading simulator based on real world data, serving as the experimental platform. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show that our method outperforms all the baselines, which reduces infections and deaths by 14.25% on average.",

    "abstract": "Annotated data samples in real-world applications are often limited. Meta-learning, which utilizes prior knowledge learned from related tasks and generalizes to new tasks of limited supervised experience, is an effective approach for few-shot learning. However, standard meta-learning with globally shared knowledge cannot handle the task heterogeneity problem well, i.e., tasks lie in different distributions. Recent advances have explored several ways to trigger task-dependent initial parameters or metrics, in order to customize task-specific information. These approaches learn task contextual information from data, but ignore external domain knowledge that can help in the learning process. In this paper, we propose a task-adaptive network (TAdaNet) that makes use of a domain-knowledge graph to enrich data representations and provide task-specific customization. Specifically, we learn a task embedding that characterizes task relationships and tailors task-specific parameters, resulting in a task-adaptive metric space for classification. Experimental results on a few-shot image classification problem show the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also apply it on a real-world disease classification problem, and show promising results for clinical decision support.",

    "abstract": "Generating molecular graphs with desired chemical properties driven by deep graph generative models provides a very promising way to accelerate drug discovery process. Such graph generative models usually consist of two steps: learning latent representations and generation of molecular graphs. However, to generate novel and chemically-valid molecular graphs from latent representations is very challenging because of the chemical constraints and combinatorial complexity of molecular graphs. In this paper, we propose MoFlow, a flow-based graph generative model to learn invertible mappings between molecular graphs and their latent representations. To generate molecular graphs, our MoFlow first generates bonds (edges) through a Glow based model, then generates atoms (nodes) given bonds by a novel graph conditional flow, and finally assembles them into a chemically valid molecular graph with a posthoc validity correction. Our MoFlow has merits including exact and tractable likelihood training, efficient one-pass embedding and generation, chemical validity guarantees, 100% reconstruction of training data, and good generalization ability. We validate our model by four tasks: molecular graph generation and reconstruction, visualization of the continuous latent space, property optimization, and constrained property optimization. Our MoFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, which implies its potential efficiency and effectiveness to explore large chemical space for drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most serious neurological diseases, affecting 1-2% of the world's population. The diagnosis of epilepsy depends heavily on the recognition of epileptic waves, i.e., disordered electrical brainwave activity in the patient's brain. Existing works have begun to employ machine learning models to detect epileptic waves via cortical electroencephalogram (EEG), which refers to brain data obtained from a noninvasive examination performed on the patient's scalp surface to record electrical activity in the brain. However, the recently developed stereoelectrocorticography (SEEG) method provides information in stereo that is more precise than conventional EEG, and has been broadly applied in clinical practice. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the first data-driven study to detect epileptic waves in a real-world SEEG dataset. While offering new opportunities, SEEG also poses several challenges. In clinical practice, epileptic wave activities are considered to propagate between different regions in the brain. These propagation paths, also known as the epileptogenic network, are deemed to be a key factor in the context of epilepsy surgery. However, the question of how to extract an exact epileptogenic network for each patient remains an open problem in the field of neuroscience. Moreover, the nature of epileptic waves and SEEG data inevitably leads to extremely imbalanced labels and severe noise. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model (BrainNet) that jointly learns the dynamic diffusion graphs and models the brain wave diffusion patterns. In addition, our model effectively aids in resisting label imbalance and severe noise by employing several self-supervised learning tasks and a hierarchical framework. By experimenting with the extensive real SEEG dataset obtained from multiple patients, we find that BrainNet outperforms several latest state-of-the-art baselines derived from time-series analysis.",

    "abstract": "Irregularly sampled multivariate time series are ubiquitous in various fields, particularly in healthcare, and exhibit two key characteristics: intra-series irregularity and inter-series discrepancy. Intra-series irregularity refers to the fact that time-series signals are often recorded at irregular intervals, while inter-series discrepancy refers to the significant variability in sampling rates among diverse series. However, recent advances in irregular time series have primarily focused on addressing intra-series irregularity, overlooking the issue of inter-series discrepancy. To bridge this gap, we present Warpformer, a novel approach that fully considers these two characteristics. In a nutshell, Warpformer has several crucial designs, including a specific input representation that explicitly characterizes both intra-series irregularity and inter-series discrepancy, a warping module that adaptively unifies irregular time series in a given scale, and a customized attention module for representation learning. Additionally, we stack multiple warping and attention modules to learn at different scales, producing multi-scale representations that balance coarse-grained and fine-grained signals for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used datasets and a new large-scale benchmark built from clinical databases. The results demonstrate the superiority of Warpformer over existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Molecular property prediction is an important problem in drug discovery and materials science. As geometric structures have been demonstrated necessary for molecular property prediction,3D information has been combined with various graph learning methods to boost prediction performance. However, obtaining the geometric structure of molecules is not feasible in many real-world applications due to the high computational cost. In this work, we propose a novel 3D pre-training framework (dubbed 3D PGT), which pre-trains a model on 3D molecular graphs, and then fine-tunes it on molecular graphs without 3D structures. Based on fact that bond length, bond angle, and dihedral angle are three basic geometric descriptors corresponding to a complete molecular 3D conformer, we first develop a multi-task generative pre-train framework based on these three attributes. Next, to automatically fuse these three generative tasks, we design a surrogate metric using the total energy to search for weight distribution of the three pretext tasks since total energy corresponding to the quality of 3D conformer. Extensive experiments on 2D molecular graphs are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and generalization ability of the proposed 3D PGT compared to various pre-training baselines.",

    "abstract": "Uncovering the organization of a landscape that encapsulates all states of a dynamic system is a central task in many domains, as it promises to reveal, in an unsupervised manner, a system's inner working. One domain where this task is crucial is in bioinformatics, where the energy landscape that organizes three-dimensional structures of a molecule by their energetics is a powerful construct. The landscape can be leveraged, among other things, to reveal macrostates where a molecule is biologically-active. This is a daunting task, as landscapes of complex actuated systems, such as molecules, are inherently high-dimensional. Nonetheless, our laboratories have made some progress via topological and statistical analysis of spatial data over the recent years. We have proposed what is essentially a dichotomy, methods that are more pertinent for visualization-driven discovery, and methods that are more pertinent for discovery of the biologically-active macrostates but not amenable to visualization. In this paper, we present a novel, hybrid method that combines strengths of these methods, allowing both visualization of the landscape and discovery of macrostates. We demonstrate what the method is capable of uncovering in comparison with existing methods over structure spaces sampled with conformational sampling algorithms. Though the direct evaluation in this paper is on protein energy landscapes, the proposed method is of broad interest in cross-cutting problems that necessitate characterization of fitness and optimization landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Together with the curse of dimensionality, nonlinear dependencies in large data sets persist as major challenges in data mining tasks. A reliable way to accurately preserve nonlinear structure is to compute geodesic distances between data points. Manifold learning methods, such as Isomap, aim to preserve geodesic distances in a Riemannian manifold. However, as manifold learning algorithms operate on the ambient dimensionality of the data, the essential step of geodesic distance computation is sensitive to high-dimensional noise. Therefore, a direct application of these algorithms to high-dimensional, noisy data often yields unsatisfactory results and does not accurately capture nonlinear structure. We propose an unsupervised random forest approach called geodesic forests (GF) to geodesic distance estimation in linear and nonlinear manifolds with noise. GF operates on low-dimensional sparse linear combinations of features, rather than the full observed dimensionality. To choose the optimal split in a computationally efficient fashion, we developed Fast-BIC, a fast Bayesian Information Criterion statistic for Gaussian mixture models. We additionally propose geodesic precision and geodesic recall as novel evaluation metrics that quantify how well the geodesic distances of a latent manifold are preserved. Empirical results on simulated and real data demonstrate that GF is robust to high-dimensional noise, whereas other methods, such as Isomap, UMAP, and FLANN, quickly deteriorate in such settings. Notably, GF is able to estimate geodesic distances better than other approaches on a real connectome dataset.",

    "abstract": "Gene Ontology (GO) is the primary gene function knowledge base that enables computational tasks in biomedicine. The basic element of GO is a term, which includes a set of genes with the same function. Existing research efforts of GO mainly focus on predicting gene term associations. Other tasks, such as generating descriptions of new terms, are rarely pursued. In this paper, we propose a novel task: GO term description generation. This task aims to automatically generate a sentence that describes the function of a GO term belonging to one of the three categories, i.e., molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. To address this task, we propose a Graph-in-Graph network that can efficiently leverage the structural information of GO. The proposed network introduces a two-layer graph: the first layer is a graph of GO terms where each node is also a graph (gene graph). Such a Graph-in-Graph network can derive the biological functions of GO terms and generate proper descriptions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed network, we build three large-scale benchmark datasets. By incorporating the proposed Graph-in-Graph network, the performances of seven different sequence-to-sequence models can be substantially boosted across all evaluation metrics, with up to 34.7%, 14.5%, and 39.1% relative improvements in BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Science and engineering fields use computer simulation extensively. These simulations are often run at multiple levels of sophistication to balance accuracy and efficiency. Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling reduces the computational cost by fusing different simulation outputs. Cheap data generated from low-fidelity simulators can be combined with limited high-quality data generated by an expensive high-fidelity simulator. Existing methods based on Gaussian processes rely on strong assumptions of the kernel functions and can hardly scale to high-dimensional settings. We propose Multi-fidelity Hierarchical Neural Processes (MF-HNP), a unified neural latent variable model for multi-fidelity surrogate modeling. MF-HNP inherits the flexibility and scalability of Neural Processes. The latent variables transform the correlations among different fidelity levels from observations to latent space. The predictions across fidelities are conditionally independent given the latent states. It helps alleviate the error propagation issue in existing methods. MF-HNP is flexible enough to handle non-nested high dimensional data at different fidelity levels with varying input and output dimensions. We evaluate MF-HNP on epidemiology and climate modeling tasks, achieving competitive performance in terms of accuracy and uncertainty estimation. In contrast to deep Gaussian Processes with only low-dimensional (< 10) tasks, our method shows great promise for speeding up high-dimensional complex simulations (over 7000 for epidemiology modeling and 45000 for climate modeling).",

    "abstract": "Medication recommendation (MR) has undergone rapid advancement in recent years, driven by its significant practical implications in healthcare. However, such high-risk scenarios still experience two critical yet overlooked challenges: the prevalent overconfidence in raw confidence for individual medications and the lack of a robust solution for confidence quantification in medication combinations. This paper represents the first in-depth study addressing this gap. We introduce two innovative methodologies tailored to the unique challenges of MR scenarios: 1) A discernible binning-based calibration method with theoretical guarantees for the confidence of individual medication. It guarantees distinct accuracy levels between adjacent bins and maintains consistent statistical reliability across calibration and test data, enabling calibrated confidence to reflect the correctness of medication recommendations distinctively. 2) A sample-based quantification method for the set confidence of medication combination, which is applicable for various existing performance metrics in MR. Utilizing representative deep MR models as backbones and conducting extensive experiments on the widely recognized MIMIC datasets, we empirically prove the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed methods. Our approaches not only improve the reliability of MR but also pave the way for more informed decision-making in clinical settings.",
