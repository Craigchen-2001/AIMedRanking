    "abstract": "Computational epidemiology is crucial in understanding and controlling infectious diseases, as highlighted by large-scale outbreaks such as COVID-19. Given the inherent uncertainty and variability of disease spread, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are widely used to predict infection peaks, estimate reproduction numbers, and evaluate the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). While effective, MC-based methods require numerous runs to achieve statistically reliable estimates and variance, which suffer from high computational costs. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for analyzing disease spread dynamics on both directed and undirected contact networks, and propose an algorithm, **RAPID**, that significantly improves computational efficiency. Our contributions are threefold. First, we derive an asymptotic variance lower bound for MC estimates and identify the key factors influencing estimation variance. Second, we provide a theoretical analysis of the probabilistic disease spread process using linear approximations and derive the convergence conditions under non-reinfection epidemic models. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on six real-world datasets, demonstrating our method's effectiveness and robustness in estimating the nodes' final state distribution. Specifically, our proposed method consistently produces accurate estimates aligned with results from a large number of MC simulations, while maintaining a runtime comparable to a single MC simulation.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose HiPoNet, an end-to-end differentiable neural network for regression, classification, and representation learning on high-dimensional point clouds. Our work is motivated by single-cell data which can have very high-dimensionality --exceeding the capabilities of existing methods for point clouds which are mostly tailored for 3D data. Moreover, modern single-cell and spatial experiments now yield entire cohorts of datasets (i.e., one data set for every patient), necessitating models that can process large, high-dimensional point-clouds at scale. Most current approaches build a single nearest-neighbor graph, discarding important geometric and topological information. In contrast,  HiPoNet models the point-cloud as a set of higher-order simplicial complexes, with each particular complex being created using a reweighting of features. This method thus generates multiple constructs corresponding to different views of high-dimensional data, which in biology offers the possibility of disentangling distinct cellular processes. It then employs simplicial wavelet transforms to extract multiscale features, capturing both local and global topology from each view. We  show that geometric and topological information is preserved in this framework both theoretically and empirically.  We showcase the utility of HiPoNet on point-cloud level tasks, involving classification and regression of entire point-clouds in data cohorts. Experimentally, we find that HiPoNet outperforms other point-cloud and graph-based models on single-cell data. We also apply HiPoNet to spatial transcriptomics datasets using spatial coordinates as one of the views. Overall, HiPoNet offers a robust and scalable solution for high-dimensional data analysis.",

Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution to address this discrepancies. However, previous single-shot TTA approaches are inefficient due to repeated training and suboptimal distributional models. Self-supervised learning methods may risk over-smoothing in scarce data scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual-Stage Distribution and Slice Adaptation (D2SA) via MRI implicit neural representation (MR-INR) to improve MRI reconstruction performance and efficiency, which features two stages. In the first stage, an MR-INR branch performs patient-wise distribution adaptation by learning shared representations across slices and modelling patient-specific shifts with mean and variance adjustments. In the second stage, single-slice adaptation refines the output from frozen convolutional layers with a learnable anisotropic diffusion module, preventing over-smoothing and reducing computation. Experiments across five MRI distribution shifts demonstrate that our method can integrate well with various self-supervised learning (SSL) framework, improving performance and accelerating convergence under diverse conditions.",

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary fMRI-to-text decoding, existing frameworks typically process the entire fMRI sequence in a single step, leading to performance degradation when handling long input sequences due to memory overload and semantic drift. To address this limitation, we propose a brain-inspired sequential fMRI-to-text decoding framework that mimics the human cognitive strategy of segmented and inductive language processing. Specifically, we divide long fMRI time series into consecutive segments aligned with optimal language comprehension length. Each segment is decoded incrementally, followed by a wrap-up mechanism that summarizes the semantic content and incorporates it as prior knowledge into subsequent decoding steps. This sequence-wise approach alleviates memory burden and ensures semantic continuity across segments. In addition, we introduce a text-guided masking strategy integrated with a masked autoencoder (MAE) framework for fMRI representation learning. This method leverages attention distributions over key semantic tokens to selectively mask the corresponding fMRI time points, and employs MAE to guide the model toward focusing on neural activity at semantically salient moments, thereby enhancing the capability of fMRI embeddings to represent textual information. Experimental results on the two datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with performance gains increasing as decoding length grows.",

We propose Anti-Causal Invariant Abstractions (ACIA), a novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning.  ACIA employs a two-level design: low-level representations capture how labels generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal patterns across environment-specific variations. ACIA addresses key limitations of existing approaches by: (1) accommodating prefect and imperfect interventions through interventional kernels, (2) eliminating dependency on explicit causal structures, (3) handling high-dimensional data effectively, and (4) providing theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on synthetic  and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ACIA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics.

A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of amortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from state-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing diffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at the scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose Progressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA) a novel framework to learn diffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation techniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion smoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low temperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher temperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the temperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables simulating the trained diffusion model to *procure training samples at a lower temperature* for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using a novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA enables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of $N$-body particle systems, Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically lower energy function evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is an effective and widely used approach to training deep learning models on decentralized datasets held by distinct clients. FL also strengthens both security and privacy protections for training data. Common challenges associated with statistical heterogeneity between distributed datasets have spurred significant interest in personalized FL (pFL) methods, where models combine aspects of global learning with local modeling specific to each client’s unique characteristics. This work investigates the efficacy of theoretically supported, adaptive MMD measures in pFL, primarily focusing on the Ditto framework, a state-of-the-art technique for distributed data heterogeneity. The use of such measures significantly improves model performance across a variety of tasks, especially those with pronounced feature heterogeneity. Additional experiments demonstrate that such measures are directly applicable to other pFL techniques and yield similar improvements across a number of datasets. Finally, the results motivate the use of constraints tailored to the various kinds of heterogeneity expected in FL systems.",

    "abstract": "Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) approaches have become popular for improved reconstruction of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Though PD-DL offers higher acceleration rates than existing clinical fast MRI techniques, their use has been limited outside specialized MRI centers. A key challenge is generalization to rare pathologies or different populations, noted in multiple studies, with fine-tuning on target populations suggested for improvement. However, current approaches for PD-DL training require access to raw k-space measurements, which is typically only available at specialized MRI centers that have research agreements for such data access. This is especially an issue for rural and under-resourced areas, where commercial MRI scanners only provide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we propose Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity (CUPID) for high-quality PD-DL training using only routine clinical reconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner. CUPID evaluates output quality with a compressibility-based approach while ensuring that the output stays consistent with the clinical parallel imaging reconstruction through well-designed perturbations. Our results show CUPID achieves similar quality to established PD-DL training that requires k-space data while outperforming compressed sensing (CS) and diffusion-based generative methods. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in a zero-shot training setup for retrospectively and prospectively sub-sampled acquisitions, attesting to its minimal training burden. As an approach that radically deviates from existing strategies, CUPID presents an opportunity to provide broader access to fast MRI for remote and rural populations in an attempt to reduce the obstacles associated with this expensive imaging modality.

While recent models increasingly incorporate multimodal data, their development typically assumes access to large-scale, multimodal datasets and substantial computational resources. In practice, however, most clinical sites operate under resource constraints, with access limited to  EHR data alone and insufficient capacity to train complicated models. This gap highlights the urgent need to democratize clinical risk prediction by enabling effective deployment in data- and resource-limited local clinical settings. In this work, we propose a cross-cohort cross-modal knowledge transfer framework that leverages the multimodal model trained on a nationwide cohort and adapts it to local cohorts with only EHR data. We focus on EHR and genetic data as representative multimodal inputs and address two key challenges. First, to mitigate the influence of noisy or less informative biological signals, we propose a novel mixture-of-aggregations design to enhance the modeling of informative and relevant genetic features. Second,  to support rapid model adaptation in low-resource sites, we develop a lightweight graph-guided fine-tuning method that adapts pretrained phenotypical EHR representations to target cohorts using limited patient data. \nExtensive experiments on real-world clinical data validate the effectiveness of our proposed model.",

At each step, selecting a node reveals its label and yields a label-dependent reward. The goal is to adaptively choose nodes to maximize expected accumulated discounted rewards. We impose a frontier exploration constraint, where actions are limited to neighbors of previously selected nodes, reflecting practical constraints in settings such as contact tracing and robotic exploration. We design a Gittins index-based policy that applies to general graphs and is provably optimal when $\\mathcal{G}$ is a forest.

Rooted in the first principles, we identify two key sub-tasks: 1) algorithm structure generation and 2) hyperparameter control. To enable systematic construction, a comprehensive modular algorithmic space is first built, embracing hundreds of algorithm components collected from decades of research. We then introduce a dual-agent reinforcement learning system that collaborates on structural and parametric design through a novel cooperative training objective, enabling large-scale meta-training across 10k diverse instances. Remarkably, through days of autonomous learning, the DesignX-generated optimizers continuously surpass human-crafted optimizers by orders of magnitude, either on synthetic testbed or on realistic optimization scenarios such as Protein-docking, AutoML and UAV path planning. Further in-depth analysis reveals DesignX's capability to discover non-trivial algorithm patterns beyond expert intuition, which, conversely, provides valuable design insights for the optimization community.

Although existing graph OOD detection methods leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically, our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7\\%, significantly surpassing the best competitor by 17.3\\% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.",

This requires resolving spatial correspondences between slices while capturing shared transcriptomic features, two tasks that are typically addressed in isolation. Multi-slice analysis remains challenging due to physical distortions, technical variability, and batch effects. To address these challenges, we introduce Joint Alignment and Deep Embedding for multi-slice ST (JADE), a unified computational framework that simultaneously learns spot-wise alignments and shared low-dimensional embeddings across tissue slices. Unlike existing methods, JADE adopts a roundtrip framework in which each iteration alternates between alignment and embedding refinement. To infer alignment, we employ attention mechanisms that dynamically assess and weight the importance of different embedding dimensions, allowing the model to focus on the most alignment-relevant features while suppressing noise. To the best of our knowledge, JADE is the first method that jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning in a shared latent space, enabling robust multi-slice integration. We demonstrate that JADE outperforms existing alignment and embedding methods across multiple evaluation metrics in the 10x Visium human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and Stereo-seq axolotl brain datasets. By bridging spatial alignment and feature integration, JADE provides a scalable and accurate solution for cross-slice analysis of ST data.",

The resulting model is broadly useful, benefiting decoding on 8 downstream decoding tasks and generalizing to a variety of neural distribution shifts.

    "abstract": "Decoding of visual stimuli from noninvasive neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) has advanced rapidly in the last years; yet, most high-performing brain decoding models rely on complicated, non-interpretable latent spaces. In this study we present an interpretable brain decoding framework that inserts a semantic bottleneck into BrainDiffuser, a well established, simple and linear decoding pipeline. We firstly produce a $214-\\text{dimensional}$ binary interpretable space $\\mathcal{L}$ for images, in which each dimension answers to a specific question about the image (e.g., \"Is there a person?\", \"Is it outdoors?\"). A first ridge regression maps voxel activity to this semantic space. Because this mapping is linear, its weight matrix can be visualized as maps of voxel importance for each dimension of $\\mathcal{L}$, revealing which cortical regions influence mostly each semantic dimension. A second regression then transforms these concept vectors into CLIP embeddings required to produce the final decoded image, conditioning the BrainDiffuser model. We found that voxel-wise weight maps for individual questions are highly consistent with canonical category-selective regions in the visual cortex (face, bodies, places, words), simultaneously revealing that activation distributions, not merely location, bear semantic meaning in the brain. Visual brain decoding performances are only slightly lower compared to the original BrainDiffuser metrics (e.g., the CLIP similarity is decreased by $\\leq 4$% for the four subjects), yet offering substantial gains in interpretability and neuroscientific insights. These results show that our interpretable brain decoding pipeline enables voxel-level analysis of semantic representations in the human brain without sacrificing decoding accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Endoscopic imaging is indispensable for visualizing internal organs, yet conventional systems remain bulky and costly because they rely on large, multi-element optics, which limits their ability to access and image certain areas of the body. Achieving high-quality endomicroscopy with hundred micron-scale and inexpensive hardware remains a grand challenge. Optical fibers offer a sub-millimeter-scale imaging conduit that could meet this need, but existing fiber-based approaches typically require either raster scanning or multicore bundles, which limit resolution and speed of imaging. In this work, we overcome these limitations by combining dual-comb interferometry with optical ghost imaging and advanced algorithm. Optical frequency combs enable precise and parallel speckle illumination via wavelength-division multiplexing through a single-core fiber, while our dual-comb compressive ghost imaging approach enables snapshot detection of bucket-sum signals using a single-pixel detector, eliminating the need for both spatial and spectral scanning. To reconstruct images from these highly compressed measurements, we introduce Optical Ghost-GPT, a transformer-based image reconstruction model that enables fast, high-fidelity recovery at low sampling rates. Our dual-comb ghost imaging approach, combined with the novel algorithm, outperforms classical ghost imaging techniques in both speed and accuracy, enabling real-time, high-resolution endoscopic imaging with a significantly reduced device footprint. This advancement paves the way for non-invasive, high-resolution, low-cost endomicroscopy and other sensing applications constrained by hardware size and complexity.",

Such deviations can result from pre-analytical variability, documentation errors, or unvalidated data sources. Effectively detecting data deviations is clinically valuable for identifying erroneous records, excluding them from downstream clinical workflows, and informing corrective actions. Despite its importance and practical relevance, this problem remains largely underexplored in existing research. To bridge this gap, we propose a bi-level knowledge distillation approach centered on a task-agnostic formulation of EHR data fidelity as an intrinsic measure of data reliability. Our approach performs layered knowledge distillation in two levels: from a computation-intensive, task-specific data Shapley oracle to a neural oracle for individual tasks, and then to a unified EHR data fidelity predictor. This design enables the integration of task-specific insights into a holistic assessment of a patient’s EHR data fidelity from a multi-task perspective. By tracking the outputs of this learned predictor, we detect potential data deviations in EHR data. Experiments on both real-world EHR data from National University Hospital in Singapore and the public MIMIC-III dataset consistently validate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting data deviations in EHR data. Case studies further demonstrate its practical value in identifying clinically meaningful data deviations.",

However, such real-world scenarios are often extremely difficult, combinatorial in nature, and require complex coordination between multiple agents. This level of complexity can cause even state-of-the-art RL systems, trained until convergence, to hit a performance ceiling which they are unable to break out of with zero-shot inference. Meanwhile, many digital or simulation-based applications allow for an inference phase that utilises a specific time and compute budget to explore multiple attempts before outputting a final solution. In this work, we show that such an inference phase employed at execution time, and the choice of a corresponding inference strategy, are key to breaking the performance ceiling observed in complex multi-agent RL problems. Our main result is striking: we can obtain up to a 126% and, on average, a 45% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art across 17 tasks, using only a couple seconds of extra wall-clock time during execution. We also demonstrate promising compute scaling properties, supported by over 60k experiments, making it the largest study on inference strategies for complex RL to date.

Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. \nLoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent.\nTo effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT).\nAdditionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4637) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549).

Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis is presented, aimed at capturing multi-scale time-frequency features across various physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks. Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating a pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for the analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impacts on wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical applications.

Despite recent advancements, EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under energy-efficiency constraints. We propose ***S$^2$M-Former***, a novel ***s***piking ***s***ymmetric ***m***ixing framework to address this limitation through two key innovations:  i)   Presenting a spike-driven symmetric architecture composed of parallel spatial and frequency branches with mirrored modular design, leveraging biologically plausible token-channel mixers to enhance complementary learning across branches; ii) Introducing lightweight 1D token sequences to replace conventional 3D operations, reducing parameters by 14.7$\\times$. The brain-inspired spiking architecture further reduces power consumption, achieving a 5.8$\\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods, while also surpassing existing SNN baselines in terms of parameter efficiency and performance. Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and AV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject) demonstrate that S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA) decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution for AAD tasks.

It can be framed as a pathfinding problem aiming to infer neural fiber trajectories from noisy and ambiguous measurements, facing challenges such as crossing, merging, and fanning white-matter configurations.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel tractography method that leverages Transformers to model the sequential nature of white matter streamlines, enabling the prediction of fiber directions by integrating both the trajectory context and current diffusion MRI measurements. To incorporate spatial information, we utilize CNNs that extract microstructural features from local neighborhoods around each voxel. By combining these complementary sources of information, our approach improves the precision and completeness of neural pathway mapping compared to traditional tractography models. We evaluate our method with the Tractometer toolkit, achieving competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches, and present qualitative results on the TractoInferno dataset, demonstrating strong generalization to real-world data.

Modern data sets often come with \"side information\" of various forms (images, text, graphs) that can be leveraged to improve estimation of the underlying structure. However, existing methods that leverage side information are limited in the types of data they can incorporate, and they assume specific parametric models. Here, we introduce a novel method for this problem, *covariate-moderated empirical Bayes matrix factorization* (cEBMF). cEBMF is a modular framework that accepts any type of side information that is processable by a probabilistic model or a neural network. The cEBMF framework can accommodate different assumptions and constraints on the factors through the use of different priors, and it adapts these priors to the data. We demonstrate the benefits of cEBMF in simulations and in analyses of spatial transcriptomics and collaborative filtering data.

In the first stage, we introduce a molecular alignment approach based on flow-matching to generate 3D coordinates for the ligand, using the template structure as a reference. In the second stage, a differentiable pose optimization procedure refines this conformation based on shape and pharmacophore similarities, internal energy, and, optionally, the protein binding pocket. We introduce a new benchmark of ligand pairs co-crystallized with the same target to evaluate our approach and show that it outperforms standard docking tools and open-access alignment methods, especially in cases involving low similarity to the template or high ligand flexibility.",

Building on these metrics, we introduce CARE, a Completeness-Aware Reconstruction Enhancement framework that incorporates structural penalties during training to encourage anatomical preservation of significant structures. CARE is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into analytical, implicit, and generative methods. \nWhen applied to these methods, CARE substantially improves structural completeness in CT reconstructions, achieving up to **32%** improvement for large organs, **22%** for small organs, **40%** for intestines, and **36%** for vessels.",

While existing methods have made considerable progress, approaches relying solely on known DDIs face a key challenge when applied to drugs with limited data: insufficient exploration of the space of unlabeled pairwise drugs.  To address these issues, we innovatively introduce S$^2$VM, a Self-supervised Visual pretraining framework for pair-wise Molecules, to fully fuse structural representations and explore the space of drug pairs for DDI prediction. S$^2$VM incorporates the explicit structure and correlations of visual molecules, such as the positional relationships and connectivity between functional substructures. Specifically, we blend the visual fragments of drug pairs into a unified input for joint encoding and then recover molecule-specific visual information for each drug individually. This approach integrates fine-grained structural representations from unlabeled drug pair data. By using visual fragments as anchors, S$^2$VM effectively captures the spatial information of local molecular components within visual molecules, resulting in more comprehensive embeddings of drug pairs. Experimental results show that S$^2$VM achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely used benchmarks, with Macro-F1 score improvements of 4.21% and 3.31%, respectively. Further extensive results and theoretical analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of S$^2$VM for both few-shot and novel drugs.",

Recent works on meta-causal models (MCM) offer a promising avenue by enabling qualitative reasoning over evolving relationships.

    "abstract": "Protein language models (PLMs) learn probability distributions over natural protein sequences. By learning from hundreds of millions of natural protein sequences, protein understanding and design capabilities emerge. Recent works have shown that scaling these models improves structure prediction, but does not seem to improve mutation understanding and representation quality for protein function prediction. We introduce PoET-2, a multimodal, retrieval-augmented protein foundation model that incorporates in-context learning of family-specific evolutionary constraints with optional structure conditioning to learn generative distributions over protein sequences. PoET-2 uses a hierarchical transformer encoder that is equivariant to sequence context ordering and a dual decoder architecture with both causal and masked language modeling objectives, allowing PoET-2 to operate in both fully generative and bidirectional representation learning modes. PoET-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot variant effect prediction, excelling at scoring variants with multiple mutations and challenging indel mutations. In supervised settings, PoET-2 embeddings outperform previous methods for learning sequence-function relationships, especially with small datasets. This work highlights the benefits of combining retrieval augmentation with multimodal, family-centric modeling for advancing protein foundation models.",

    "abstract": "Masked Graph Autoencoders (MGAEs) have gained significant attention recently. Their proxy tasks typically involve random corruption of input graphs followed by reconstruction. However, in the molecular domain, two main issues arise: the predetermined mask ratio and reconstruction objectives can lead to suboptimal performance or negative transfer due to overly simplified or complex tasks, and these tasks may deviate from chemical priors. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and Chemical Constraints (DyCC) for MGAEs. This includes a masking strategy called GIBMS, which preserves essential semantic information during graph masking while adaptively adjusting the mask ratio and content for each molecule. Additionally, we introduce a Soft Label Generator (SLG) that reconstructs masked tokens as learnable prototypes (soft labels) rather than hard labels. These components adhere to chemical constraints and allow dynamic variation of proxy tasks during training. We integrate the model-agnostic DyCC into various MGAEs and conduct comprehensive experiments, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures.

While traditional docking methods are generally reliable, they are often computationally expensive. Recent deep learning (DL) approaches have substantially accelerated docking and improved prediction accuracy; however, they frequently generate conformations that lack physical plausibility due to insufficient integration of physical priors. To deal with these challenges, we propose ForceFM, a novel force-guided model that integrates a force-guided network into the generation process, steering ligand poses toward low-energy, physically realistic conformations. Force guidance also halves inference cost compared with the unguided approaches. Importantly, replacing the guiding potential with diverse energy functions-including Vina, Glide, Gnina, and Confscore-preserves or improves performance, underscoring the method's generality and robustness.

    "abstract": "Intracranial recordings have opened a unique opportunity to simultaneously measure activity across multiregional networks in the human brain. Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance.",

In the study of the biological visual system, naturalistic visual stimuli are inherently high-dimensional and time-dependent, leading to intricate dynamics within visual neural activity. However, most work on LVMs has not explicitly considered neural temporal relationships. To cope with such conditions, we propose Time-Evolving Visual Dynamical System (TE-ViDS), a sequential LVM that decomposes neural activity into low-dimensional latent representations that evolve over time. To better align the model with the characteristics of visual neural activity, we split latent representations into two parts and apply contrastive learning to shape them. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real neural datasets from the mouse visual cortex demonstrate that TE-ViDS achieves the best decoding performance on naturalistic scenes/movies, extracts interpretable latent trajectories that uncover clear underlying neural dynamics, and provides new insights into differences in visual information processing between subjects and between cortical regions. In summary, TE-ViDS is markedly competent in extracting stimulus-relevant embeddings from visual neural activity and contributes to the understanding of visual processing mechanisms.

Such methods, biased by majority classes or prone to overfitting on scarce tail data, frequently fail to identify the very instances—novel materials, rare disease biomarkers, faint astronomical signals—that drive scientific breakthroughs. This paper introduces a novel, end-to-end framework explicitly designed to address pathological long-tailed recognition in scientific contexts. Our approach synergizes a Balanced Supervised Contrastive Learning (B-SCL) mechanism, which enhances the representation of tail classes by dynamically re-weighting their contributions, with a Smooth Objective Regularization (SOR) strategy that manages the inherent tension between tail-class focus and overall classification performance. We introduce and analyze the real-world ZincFluor chemical dataset ($\\mathcal{T}=137.54$) and synthetic benchmarks with controllable extreme imbalances (CIFAR-LT variants). Extensive evaluations demonstrate our method's superior ability to decipher these extremes. Notably, on ZincFluor, our approach achieves a Tail Top-2 accuracy of $66.84\\%$, significantly outperforming existing techniques. On CIFAR-10-LT with an imbalance ratio of $1000$ ($\\mathcal{T}=100$), our method achieves a tail-class accuracy of $38.99\\%$, substantially leading the next best. These results underscore our framework's potential to unlock novel insights from complex, imbalanced scientific datasets, thereby accelerating discovery.",

To address this need, we present a family of Universal Models for Atoms (UMA), designed to push the frontier of speed, accuracy, and generalization. UMA models are trained on half a billion unique 3D atomic structures (the largest training runs to date) by compiling data across multiple chemical domains, e.g. molecules, materials, and catalysts. We develop empirical scaling laws to help understand how to increase model capacity alongside dataset size to achieve the best accuracy. The UMA small and medium models utilize a novel architectural design we refer to as mixture of linear experts that enables increasing model capacity without sacrificing speed. For example, UMA-medium has 1.4B parameters but only $\\sim$50M active parameters per atomic structure. We evaluate UMA models on a diverse set of applications across multiple domains and find that, remarkably, a single model without any fine-tuning can perform similarly or better than specialized models. We are releasing the UMA code, weights, and associated data to accelerate computational workflows and enable the community to build increasingly capable AI models.",

Traditional discriminative models frequently underperform in such settings. We propose BioCG (Biochemical Constrained Generation), a novel framework that reformulates interaction prediction as a constrained sequence generation task. BioCG encodes target entities as unique discrete sequences via Iterative Residual Vector Quantization (I-RVQ) and trains a generative model to produce the sequence of an interacting partner given a query entity. A trie-guided constrained decoding mechanism, built from a catalog of valid target sequences, concentrates the model's learning on the critical distinctions between valid biochemical options, ensuring all outputs correspond to an entity within the pre-defined target catalog. An information-weighted training objective further focuses learning on the most critical decision points. BioCG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across diverse tasks, Drug-Target Interaction (DTI), Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI), and Enzyme-Reaction Prediction, especially in data-scarce and cold-start conditions. On the BioSNAP DTI benchmark, for example, BioCG attains an AUC of 89.31\\% on unseen proteins, representing a 14.3 percentage point gain over prior SOTA. By directly generating interacting partners from a known biochemical space, BioCG provides a robust and data-efficient solution for in-silico biochemical discovery.",

Electrophysiological signals are the direct manifestation of brain activities, thus, characterizing the whole brain electrophysiological networks (WBEN) can serve as a fundamental tool for neuroscience studies and clinical applications. In this work, we introduce the first framework for the integration of scalp EEG and intracranial EEG (iEEG) for the WBEN estimation with a principled estimation framework based on state-space models, where an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is designed to infer the state variables and brain connectivity simultaneously. We validated the proposed method on synthetic data, and the results revealed improved performance compared to traditional two-step methods using scalp EEG only, demonstrating the importance of including iEEG signal for WBEN estimation. For real data with simultaneous EEG and iEEG, we applied the developed framework to understand the information flows of the encoding and maintenance phases during the working memory task. The information flows between the subcortical and cortical regions are delineated, highlighting more significant information flows from cortical to subcortical regions than maintenance phases. The results are consistent with previous research findings but with the view of the whole brain scope, which underscores the unique utility of the proposed framework.",

Self-refinement methods attempt to leverage LLMs' internal evaluation mechanisms with minimal human supervision; however, these approaches frequently suffer from inherent biases and overconfidence, especially in domains where the models lack sufficient internal knowledge, resulting in performance degradation. As an initial step toward enhancing self-refinement for broader applications, we introduce an iterative refinement pipeline that employs the Unlabeled-Unlabeled learning framework to improve LLM-generated pseudo-labels for classification tasks. By exploiting two unlabeled datasets with differing positive class ratios, our approach iteratively denoises and refines the initial pseudo-labels, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of internal biases with minimal human supervision. Evaluations on diverse datasets, including low-resource language corpora, patent classifications, and protein structure categorizations, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both initial LLM's classification performance and the self-refinement approaches by cutting-edge models (e.g., GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1). Moreover, we experimentally confirm that our refined classifier facilitates effective post-training alignment for safety in LLMs and demonstrate successful self-refinement in generative tasks as well.

Artificial neural networks trained to predict neural responses to visual stimuli (“digital twins”) could provide a powerful framework for studying such complex computations in silico. However, while current models accurately capture single-neuron responses within individual visual areas, their ability to reproduce how populations of neurons represent object identity, and how these representations transform across the cortical hierarchy, remains largely unexplored. Here we examine key functional signatures observed experimentally and find that current models account for hierarchical changes in basic single-neuron properties, such as receptive field size, but fail to capture more complex population-level phenomena, particularly invariant object representations. To address this gap, we introduce a biologically inspired hierarchical readout scheme that mirrors cortical anatomy, modeling each visual area as a projection from a distinct depth within a shared core network. This approach significantly improves the prediction of population-level  representational transformations, outperforming standard models that use only the final layer, as well as alternatives with modified architecture, regularization, and loss function. Our results suggest that incorporating anatomical information provides a strong inductive bias in digital twin models, enabling them to better capture general principles of brain function.",

Contrastive learning is a powerful self-supervised framework for learning representations of complex datasets. Existing applications for neural time series rely on generic data augmentations and do not exploit the multi-trial data structure inherent in many neural datasets. Here we present TRACE, a new contrastive learning framework that averages across different subsets of trials to generate positive pairs. TRACE allows to directly learn a two-dimensional embedding, combining ideas from contrastive learning and neighbor embeddings. We show that TRACE outperforms other methods, resolving fine response differences in simulated data. Further, using in vivo recordings, we show that the representations learned by TRACE capture both biologically relevant continuous variation, cell-type-related cluster structure, and can assist data quality control.",

To address this, we are pioneers in establishing the theoretical bridge between concept drift theory and RFT processes by formalizing CoT's autoregressive token streams as non-stationary distributions undergoing arbitrary temporal shifts. Leveraging this framework, we propose a novel autonomous counterfact-aware RFT that systematically decouples beneficial distribution adaptation from harmful concept drift through concept graph-empowered LLM experts generating counterfactual reasoning trajectories. Our solution, Counterfactual Preference Optimization (CPO), enables autonomous and stable RFT in non-stationary environments, particularly within the medical domain, through custom-tuning of counterfactual-aware preference alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance of robustness, generalization and coordination within RFT. Besides, we also contribute a large-scale dataset CXR-CounterFact (CCF), comprising 320,416 meticulously curated counterfactual reasoning trajectories derived from MIMIC-CXR.

Large, autoregressive models trained on databases of chemical compounds have yielded powerful generators, but we still lack robust strategies for generating molecules with desired properties. This molecular search problem closely resembles the \"alignment\" problem for large language models, though for many chemical tasks we have a specific and easily evaluable reward function. Here, we introduce an algorithm called energy rank alignment (ERA) that leverages an explicit reward function to produce a gradient-based objective that we use to optimize autoregressive policies.  \nWe show theoretically that this algorithm is closely related to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and direct preference optimization (DPO), but has a minimizer that converges to an ideal Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with the reward playing the role of an energy function. \nFurthermore, this algorithm is highly scalable, does not require reinforcement learning, and performs well relative to DPO when the number of preference observations per pairing is small. We deploy this approach to align molecular transformers and protein language models to generate molecules and protein sequences, respectively, with externally specified\nproperties and find that it does so robustly, searching through diverse parts of chemical space.",

Previous studies mostly focused on aligning multi-day neural signals of onto a low-dimensional latent manifold to reduce the variabilities, while faced with difficulties when neural signals exhibit significant drift. Here, we propose to learn a channel-level invariant neural representation to address the variabilities in channels across days. It contains a channel-rearrangement module to learn stable representations against electrode shifts, and a channel reconstruction module to handle the missing neurons. The proposed method achieved the state-of-the-art performance with cross-day decoding tasks over two months, on multiple benchmark BCI datasets.

We introduce SHAP zero, a novel algorithm that amortizes the cost of Shapley value computation across large-scale biological datasets. After a one-time model sketching step, SHAP zero enables near-zero marginal cost for future queries by uncovering an underexplored connection between Shapley values, high-order feature interactions, and the sparse Fourier transform of the model. Applied to models of guide RNA efficacy, DNA repair outcomes, and protein fitness, SHAP zero explains predictions orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, recovering rich combinatorial interactions previously inaccessible at scale.

However, traditional probabilistic verification methods struggle to scale effectively with the size and depth of modern SSNs, especially when dealing with their high-dimensional, structured inputs/outputs. As the output dimension increases, these methods tend to become overly conservative, resulting in unnecessarily restrictive safety guarantees. In this work, we propose a probabilistic, data-driven verification algorithm that is architecture-agnostic and scalable, capable of handling the high-dimensional outputs of SSNs without introducing conservative and loose guarantees. We leverage efficient sampling-based reachability analysis to explore the space of possible outputs while maintaining computational feasibility. Our methodology is based on Conformal Inference (CI), which is known for its high data efficiency. However, CI tends to be overly conservative in high-dimensional spaces. To address this, in this paper, we introduce techniques to mitigate these sources of conservatism, enabling us to provide less conservative yet provable guarantees for SSNs. We validate our approach on large segmentation models applied to CamVid, OCTA-500 and Lung\\_Segmentation, and Cityscapes datasets, showing that it can offer reliable safety guarantees while lowering the conservatism inherent in traditional methods. We also provide a public GitHub repository for this approach, to support reproducibility.",

These systems require models that can simultaneously capture fine-grained atomic interactions, long-range dependencies across spatially distant components, and biologically relevant hierarchical structure—such as atoms forming residues, which in turn form higher-order domains. Existing geometric GNNs, which typically operate exclusively in either Euclidean or Spherical Harmonics space, are limited in their ability to capture both the fine-scale atomic details and the long-range, symmetry-aware dependencies required for modeling the multi-scale structure of large biomolecules. We introduce DualEquiNet, a Dual-Space Hierarchical Equivariant Network that constructs complementary representations in both Euclidean and Spherical Harmonics spaces to capture local geometry and global symmetry-aware features. DualEquiNet employs bidirectional cross-space message passing and a novel Cross-Space Interaction Pooling mechanism to hierarchically aggregate atomic features into biologically meaningful units, such as residues, enabling efficient and expressive multi-scale modeling for large biomolecular systems. DualEquiNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing benchmarks for RNA property prediction and protein modeling, and outperforms prior methods on two newly introduced 3D structural benchmarks demonstrating its broad effectiveness across a range of large biomolecule modeling tasks.",

    "abstract": "Event sequences appear widely in domains such as medicine, finance, and remote sensing, yet modeling them is challenging due to their heterogeneity: sequences often contain multiple event types with diverse structures—for example, electronic health records that mix discrete events like medical procedures with continuous lab measurements. Existing approaches either tokenize all entries, violating natural inductive biases, or ignore parts of the data to enforce a consistent structure. In this work, we propose a simple yet powerful Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) framework for modeling event sequences with flexible structure, using a single unified model. Our approach employs a single autoregressive transformer with discrete and continuous prediction heads, capable of modeling variable-length, mixed-type event sequences. The continuous head leverages an expressive normalizing flow to model continuous event attributes, avoiding the numerical integration required for inter-event times in most competing methods. Empirically, our model excels on both discrete-only and mixed-type sequences, improving prediction quality and enabling interpretable uncertainty quantification. We make our code public at https://github.com/czi-ai/FlexTPP.",

However, current single-cell crossmodal models often suffer from three limitations: sparse modality signals, underutilization of biological attributes, and insufficient modeling of regulatory interactions. These challenges hinder generalization in data-scarce settings and restrict the ability to uncover fine-grained biologically meaningful crossmodal relationships. \nHere, we present a novel framework which reformulates crossmodal matching as a graph classification task on Attributed Bipartite Graphs (ABGs).  It models single-cell ATAC-RNA data as an ABG, where each expressed ATAC and RNA is treated as a distinct node with unique IDs and biological features. To model crossmodal interaction patterns on the constructed ABG, we propose $\\text{Bi}^2\\text{Former}$, a **bi**ologically-driven **bi**partite graph trans**former** that learns interpretable attention over ATAC–RNA pairs. This design enables the model to effectively learn and explain biological regulatory relationships between ATAC and RNA modalities.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that $\\text{Bi}^2\\text{Former}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in crossmodal matching across diverse datasets, remains robust under sparse training data, generalizes to unseen cell types and datasets, and reveals biologically meaningful regulatory patterns. \nThis work pioneers an ABG-based approach for single-cell crossmodal matching, offering a powerful framework for uncovering regulatory interactions at the single-cell omics.

We validate its effectiveness in synthetic experiments and in a real-world analysis of wildfire smoke exposure and respiratory hospitalizations during the 2018 California Camp Fire.

We take a step in this direction by developing a spatially extended neural network model integrated with a spectral theory of its connectivity matrix. Our theory quantitatively demonstrates how local structural parameters, such as E/I neuron projection ranges, connection strengths, and density determine distinct features of the eigenvalue spectrum, specifically outlier eigenvalues and a bulk disk. These spectral signatures, in turn, precisely predict the network's emergent global dynamical regime, encompassing asynchronous states, synchronous states, oscillations, localized activity bumps, traveling waves, and chaos. Motivated by observations of shifting cortical dynamics in mice across arousal states, our framework not only provides a possible explanation for repertoire of behaviors but also offers a principled starting point for inferring underlying effective connectivity changes from macroscopic brain activity. By mechanistically linking neural structure to dynamics, this work advances a principled framework for dissecting how large-scale activity patterns—central to cognition and open questions in consciousness research—arise from, and constrain, local circuitry.

We introduce a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) for 3D molecules, named MolFLAE, which learns a fixed-dimensional, E(3)-equivariant latent space independent of atom counts. MolFLAE encodes 3D molecules using an E(3)-equivariant neural network into fixed number of latent nodes, distinguished by learned embeddings. The latent space is regularized, and molecular structures are reconstructed via a Bayesian Flow Network (BFN) conditioned on the encoder’s latent output. MolFLAE achieves competitive performance on standard unconditional 3D molecule generation benchmarks. Moreover, the latent space of MolFLAE enables zero-shot molecule manipulation, including atom number editing, structure reconstruction, and coordinated latent interpolation for both structure and properties. We further demonstrate our approach on a drug optimization task for the human glucocorticoid receptor, generating molecules with improved hydrophilicity while preserving key interactions, under computational evaluations.

The architecture features two distinct modules: one for learning structural connectivity and another for predicting future spiking activity via a graph neural network (GNN).

We evaluate this approach using synthetic data generated from ring attractor network models and real spike recordings from head direction cells in mice. Across a wide range of conditions, including varying recurrent connectivity, external inputs, and incomplete observations, our model reliably resolves spurious correlations and recovers accurate weight profiles. When applied to real data, the inferred connectivity aligns with theoretical predictions of continuous attractor models.

While foundation models have achieved significant success in single-cell transcriptomics, there is currently no foundation model for scATAC-seq that supports zero-shot high-quality cell identification and comprehensive multi-omics analysis simultaneously. Key challenges lie in the high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data, as well as the lack of a standardized schema for representing open chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we present ChromFound, a foundation model tailored for scATAC-seq. ChromFound utilizes a hybrid architecture and genome-aware tokenization to effectively capture genome-wide long contexts and regulatory signals from dynamic chromatin landscapes. Pretrained on 1.97 million cells from 30 tissues and 6 disease conditions, ChromFound demonstrates broad applicability across 6 diverse tasks. Notably, it achieves robust zero-shot performance in generating universal cell representations and exhibits excellent transferability in cell type annotation and cross-omics prediction. By uncovering enhancer-gene links undetected by existing computational methods, ChromFound offers a promising framework for understanding disease risk variants in the noncoding genome.

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) has wide-ranging applications, from clinical diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). With the increasing volume and variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open challenges, we propose **NeurIPT**, a foundation model tailored for diverse EEG-based **Neur**al **I**nterfaces with a **P**re-trained **T**ransformer by capturing both homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP), masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation. Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a progressive Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features. Empirical evaluations across nine downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning and training from scratch, demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and generalizable neural information processing systems.",

The model was pretrained on two of the largest neuroimaging datasets to date, encompassing 64,594 T1-weighted structural MRI 3D volumes (～ 14 million images) and 70,933 functional MRI (fMRI) time series. BrainHarmonix is grounded in two foundational neuroscience principles: *structure complements function* - structural and functional modalities offer distinct yet synergistic insights into brain organization; *function follows structure* - brain functional dynamics are shaped by cortical morphology. The modular pretraining process involves single-modality training with geometric pre-alignment followed by modality fusion through shared brain hub tokens. Notably, our dynamics encoder uniquely handles fMRI time series with heterogeneous repetition times (TRs), addressing a major limitation in existing models. BrainHarmonix is also the first to deeply compress high-dimensional neuroimaging signals into unified, continuous 1D tokens, forming a compact latent space of the human brain. BrainHarmonix achieves strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder classification and cognition prediction - consistently outperforming previous approaches. Our models - pretrained on 8 H100 GPUs - aim to catalyze a new era of AI-driven neuroscience powered by large-scale multimodal neuroimaging.",

This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable asset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new inference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that closely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not consider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and specifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of desiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise downstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the treatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism. Based on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess such synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the data-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our desiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models, particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.",

Traditional approaches often seek a single Pareto-optimal set that balances trade-offs among all objectives. \nIn contrast, we consider a problem setting that departs from this paradigm: finding a small set of $K < T$ solutions, that collectively \"cover\" the $T$ objectives. A set of solutions is defined as \"covering\" if, for each objective $f_1, \\ldots f_T$, there is at least one good solution. \nA motivating example for this problem setting occurs in drug design. \nFor example, we may have $T$ pathogens and aim to identify a set of $K < T$ antibiotics such that at least one antibiotic can be used to treat each pathogen. \nThis problem, known as coverage optimization, has yet to be tackled with the Bayesian optimization (BO) framework.\nTo fill this void, we develop Multi-Objective Coverage Bayesian Optimization (MOCOBO), a BO algorithm for solving coverage optimization. \nOur approach is based on a new acquisition function reminiscent of expected improvement in the vanilla BO setup.\nWe demonstrate the performance of our method on high-dimensional black-box optimization tasks, including applications in peptide and molecular design.\nResults show that the coverage of the $K < T$ solutions found by MOCOBO matches or nearly matches the coverage of $T$ solutions obtained by optimizing each objective individually.\nFurthermore, in *in vitro* experiments, the peptides found by MOCOBO exhibited high potency against drug-resistant pathogens, further demonstrating the potential of MOCOBO for drug discovery.\nAll of our code is publicly available at the following link: https://github.com/nataliemaus/mocobo.",

Using smaller patches as tokens can enhance ViT performance, but quadratically increases computation and memory requirements. Therefore, the common practice for applying ViTs to high-resolution images is either to: (a) employ complex sub-quadratic attention schemes or (b) use large to medium-sized patches and rely on additional mechanisms within the model to capture the spatial hierarchy of details. We propose Symmetrical Hierarchical Forest (SHF), a lightweight approach that adaptively patches the input image to increase token information density and encode hierarchical spatial structures into the input embedding. We then apply a reverse depatching scheme to the output embeddings of the transformer encoder, eliminating the need for convolution-based decoders. Unlike previous methods that modify attention mechanisms \\wahib{or use a complex hierarchy of interacting models}, SHF can be retrofitted to any ViT model to allow it to learn the hierarchical structure of details in high-resolution images without requiring architectural changes. Experimental results demonstrate significant gains in computational efficiency and performance: on the PAIP WSI dataset, we achieved a 3$\\sim$32$\\times$ speedup or a 2.95\\% to 7.03\\% increase in accuracy (measured by Dice score) at a $64K^2$ resolution with the same computational budget, compared to state-of-the-art production models.

In this work, we apply tools from Random Matrix Theory to investigate how such limitations affect similarity measures, focusing on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). We propose an analytical framework for representational similarity analysis that relates measured similarities to the spectral properties of the underlying representations. We demonstrate that neural similarities are systematically underestimated under finite neuron sampling, mainly due to eigenvector delocalization. To overcome this, we introduce a denoising method to infer population-level similarity, enabling accurate analysis even with small neuron samples.

    "abstract": "In the molecular domain, numerous studies have explored the use of multimodal large language models (LLMs) to construct a general-purpose, multi-task molecular model. However, these efforts are still far from achieving a truly universal molecular model. We identify three key challenges in this endeavor: (1) Existing molecular task datasets are typically small in scale and lack comprehensive domain coverage. (2) Tasks from different molecular subfields are difficult to effectively learn jointly through LLMs due to significant distributional shifts and competition among tasks, which introduces instability in the learning process. (3) Both inter-task and intra-task molecular representations demand different intrinsic dimensions in the language space, making it challenging to balance between redundancy and insufficiency in language model representations. To address these challenges, we innovatively categorize existing small-molecule tasks into four types: Mol2Mol, Mol2Text, Mol2Num, and Text2Mol. We then collect a dataset encompassing over 16 tasks with more than 1.4 million samples, making it the largest molecular instruction-tuning dataset to date. Leveraging the extensive pretraining of LLMs on existing chemical literature, we propose a novel multimodal LLM framework, named **Omni-Mol**, which unifies all small-molecule tasks and supports both molecular generation and understanding. The core of Omni-Mol is our proposed MoGE, which dynamically adapts to the intrinsic rank of different tasks. This mixture-of-experts architecture enhances the model's ability to handle diverse tasks and modalities effectively. Our model achieves unified instruction tuning across 16 tasks and attains state-of-the-art performance on 13 of them. Extensive experiments further demonstrate the scalability and versatility of Omni-Mol.",

Recent advances in heterogeneous multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) have facilitated comprehensive joint diagnosis, yet practical clinical scenarios frequently encounter incomplete modalities due to factors like high acquisition costs or radiation risks. Moreover, traditional convolution-based architecture face inherent limitations in capturing long-range dependencies and handling heterogeneous medical data efficiently. To address these challenges, in our proposed heterogeneous multimodal diagnostic framework (HAD), we develop a multi-view Hilbert curve-based Mamba block and a hierarchical spatial feature extraction module to simultaneously capture local spatial features and global dependencies, effectively alleviating spatial discontinuities introduced by voxel serialization. Furthermore, to balance semantic consistency and modal specificity, we build a unified mutual information learning objective in the heterogeneous multimodal embedding space, which maintains effective learning of modality-specific information to avoid modality collapse caused by model preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various modality-missing scenarios, providing an efficient and reliable solution for early-stage AD diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose *Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP)*, an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with 20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering greater interpretability.",

In this study, we enhance the prediction of solute-solvent properties by proposing a novel sample selection method: the iterative core subset extraction (CSIE) framework. CSIE iteratively updates the core sample subset based on information gain to remove redundant features in theoretical data and optimize the performance of the model on real chemical datasets.

In this work, we provide a novel conformal prediction method for potential outcomes of continuous treatments. We account for the additional uncertainty introduced through propensity estimation so that our conformal prediction intervals are valid even if the propensity score is unknown. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We derive finite-sample validity guarantees for prediction intervals of potential outcomes of continuous treatments. (2) We provide an algorithm for calculating the derived intervals. (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of the conformal prediction intervals in experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

    "abstract": "Generative models trained on natural sequences are increasingly used to predict the effects of genetic variation, enabling progress in therapeutic design, disease risk prediction, and synthetic biology. In the zero-shot setting, variant impact is estimated by comparing the likelihoods of sequences, under the assumption that likelihood serves as a proxy for fitness. However, this assumption often breaks down in practice: sequence likelihood reflects not only evolutionary fitness constraints, but also phylogenetic structure and sampling biases, especially as model capacity increases. We introduce Likelihood-Fitness Bridging (LFB), a simple and general strategy that improves variant effect prediction by averaging model scores across sequences subject to similar selective pressures. Assuming an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of evolution, LFB can be viewed as a way to marginalize the effects of genetic drift, although its benefits appear to extend more broadly. LFB applies to existing protein and genomic language models without requiring retraining, and incurs only modest computational overhead. Evaluated on large-scale deep mutational scans and clinical benchmarks, LFB consistently improves predictive performance across model families and sizes. Notably, it reverses the performance plateau observed in larger protein language models, making the largest models the most accurate when combined with LFB. These results suggest that accounting for phylogenetic and sampling biases is essential to realizing the full potential of large sequence models in variant effect prediction.",

While successful in language and vision, their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets, which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing.\nWe present REVE (Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to date.\nREVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks, including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging, cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.",

Extensive evaluations across four datasets with different anatomies demonstrate RAD's generalizability, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Our baseline, PCA+, uses alignment-only contrastive learning and succeeds when background variation is mild, but fails under strong noise or high-dimensional regimes. To address this, we introduce PCA++, a hard uniformity-constrained contrastive PCA that enforces identity covariance on projected features. PCA++ has a closed-form solution via a generalized eigenproblem, remains stable in high dimensions, and provably regularizes against background interference. We provide exact high-dimensional asymptotics in both fixed-aspect-ratio and growing-spike regimes, showing uniformity’s role in robust signal recovery. Empirically, PCA++ outperforms standard PCA and alignment-only PCA+ on simulations, corrupted-MNIST, and single-cell transcriptomics, reliably recovering condition-invariant structure. More broadly, we clarify uniformity’s role in contrastive learning—showing that explicit feature dispersion defends against structured noise and enhances robustness.",

These models typically rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for whole slide image (WSI) classification or apply multimodal approaches to generate reports directly from images. However, these models cannot emulate the diagnostic approach of pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification to obtain an overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. Instead, existing models directly output final diagnoses without revealing the underlying reasoning process.\nTo address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based approach that mimics pathologists' diagnostic workflow by autonomously navigating across WSI through zoom-in/out and move operations based on observed visual features, thereby generating substantially more transparent and interpretable diagnostic summaries. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy that unifies patch-level, region-level, and WSI-level capabilities within a single model, which is essential for replicating how pathologists understand and reason across diverse image scales.\nAdditionally, we construct PathMMU-HR², the first expert-validated benchmark for large region analysis. This represents a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, reflecting a key clinical reality where pathologists typically examine several key large regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across benchmarks at three different image scales, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for computational pathology.",

Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models.",

Current 3D pose estimation techniques, such as keypoint- and mesh-based techniques, often face challenges including limited representational detail, labor-intensive annotation requirements, and expensive per-frame optimization. These limitations hinder the study of subtle movements and can make large-scale analyses impractical. We propose *Pose Splatter*, a novel framework leveraging shape carving and 3D Gaussian splatting to model the complete pose and appearance of laboratory animals without prior knowledge of animal geometry, per-frame optimization, or manual annotations.\n  We also propose a rotation-invariant visual embedding technique for encoding pose and appearance, designed to be a plug-in replacement for 3D keypoint data in downstream behavioral analyses.\n  Experiments on datasets of mice, rats, and zebra finches show *Pose Splatter* learns accurate 3D animal geometries. Notably, *Pose Splatter* represents subtle variations in pose, provides better low-dimensional pose embeddings over state-of-the-art as evaluated by humans, and generalizes to unseen data.\n  By eliminating annotation and per-frame optimization bottlenecks, *Pose Splatter* enables analysis of large-scale, longitudinal behavior needed to map genotype, neural activity, and behavior at high resolutions.",

While artificial neural networks pretrained on large-scale datasets exhibit striking representational alignment with human neural responses, learning image-computable models of visual cortex relies on individual-level, large-scale fMRI datasets. The necessity for expensive, time-intensive, and often impractical data acquisition limits the generalizability of encoders to new subjects and stimuli. **BraInCoRL** uses in-context learning to predict voxelwise neural responses from few-shot examples *without any additional finetuning* for novel subjects and stimuli. We leverage a transformer architecture that can flexibly condition on a variable number of in-context image stimuli, learning an inductive bias over multiple subjects. During training, we explicitly optimize the model for in-context learning. By jointly conditioning on image features and voxel activations, our model learns to directly generate better performing voxelwise models of higher visual cortex. We demonstrate that BraInCoRL consistently outperforms existing voxelwise encoder designs in a low-data regime when evaluated on entirely novel images, while also exhibiting strong test-time scaling behavior. The model also generalizes to an entirely new visual fMRI dataset, which uses different subjects and fMRI data acquisition parameters. Further, BraInCoRL facilitates better interpretability of neural signals in higher visual cortex by attending to semantically relevant stimuli. Finally, we show that our framework enables interpretable mappings from natural language queries to voxel selectivity.",

In this paper, we reformulate the noising and denoising processes to support monotonic insertion and deletion of nodes. The resulting model, which we call GrIDDD, dynamically grows or shrinks the chemical graph during generation. GrIDDD matches or exceeds the performance of existing graph diffusion models on molecular property targeting despite being trained on a more difficult problem. Furthermore, when applied to molecular optimization, GrIDDD exhibits competitive performance compared to specialized optimization models.

We conjecture that such a representation can be used for downstream tasks such as tactile imaging and change detection. With enough training data, it should capture intricate patterns in the tactile measurements that go beyond a simple map of forces -- the current state of the art. To validate our approach, we both develop a simulation environment and collect a real-world dataset of soft objects and corresponding ground truth images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We collect palpation sequences using a robot equipped with a tactile sensor, and train a model that predicts sensory readings at different positions on the object. We investigate the representation learned in this process, and demonstrate its use in imaging and change detection.",

These systems exhibit self-organized spatiotemporal patterns of synchronized neural oscillations, enabling the representation of abstract concepts. By capitalizing on the unprecedented amount of human neuroimaging data, we propose that advancing the theoretical understanding of rhythmic coordination in neural circuits can offer powerful design principles for the next generation of machine learning models with improved efficiency and robustness. To this end, we introduce a physics-informed deep learning framework for \\underline{B}rain \\underline{R}hythm \\underline{I}dentification by \\underline{K}uramoto and \\underline{C}ontrol (coined \\modelname{}) to characterize the synchronization of neural oscillations that shapes the dynamics of evolving cognitive states.  Recognizing that brain networks are structurally connected yet behaviorally dynamic, we further conceptualize rhythmic neural activity as an artificial dynamical system of coupled oscillators, offering a shared mechanistic bridge to brain-inspired machine intelligence. By treating each node as an oscillator interacting with its neighbors, this approach moves beyond the conventional paradigm of graph heat diffusion and establishes a new regime of representation compression through oscillatory synchronization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this synchronization-driven mechanism not only mitigates over-smoothing in deep GNNs but also enhances the model’s capacity for reasoning and solving complex graph-based problems.",

In this work, we present a cascaded LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy determines whether to accept the base model’s answer or regenerate it with the large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human intervention. Moreover, to overcome static policies and accommodate changing task difficulty, we incorporate an online learning mechanism which uses human feedback. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, and MMLU) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results demonstrate that our cascaded strategy outperforms single-model baselines in most cases, achieving higher accuracy while reducing costs and providing a principled approach to handling abstentions.",

Classical approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in-full for each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has inspired interest into overcoming this limitation through learning sampling algorithms. Despite performing on par with conventional methods when trained on a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to transfer across systems. We prove that deep learning enables the design of scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Ensemble, a 200 million parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Ensemble draws zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems, achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length, whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows. Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Ensemble as a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve superior performance to established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo. We open-source the Ensemble codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.",

Key criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in data space, making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of watermarking directly in data space while handling feature heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark directly within the temporal-feature data space. The other unique feature is the $\\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time series while preserving robust watermark detectability. We extensively evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against five datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in correlational scores against the strongest state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining consistently detectable.",

However, achieving pathology-correct cross-dye virtual staining with versatile tone controls poses significant challenges due to the difficulty of decoupling the given pathology and tone conditions. This issue would cause non-pathologic regions to be mistakenly stained like pathologic ones, and vice versa, which we term “pathology leakage.” To address this issue, we propose diffusion virtual staining Transformer (D-VST), a new framework with versatile tone control for cross-dye virtual staining. Specifically, we introduce a pathology encoder in conjunction with a tone encoder, combined with a two-stage curriculum learning scheme that decouples pathology and tone conditions, to enable tone control while eliminating pathology leakage. Further, to extend our method for billion-pixel whole slide image (WSI) staining, we introduce a novel frequency-aware adaptive patch sampling strategy for high-quality yet efficient inference of ultra-high resolution images in a zero-shot manner. Integrating these two innovative components facilitates a pathology-correct, tone-controllable, cross-dye WSI virtual staining process. Extensive experiments on three virtual staining tasks that involve translating between four different dyes demonstrate the superiority of our approach in generating high-quality and pathologically accurate images compared to existing methods based on generative adversarial networks and diffusion models. Our code and trained models will be released.",

This has enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned 3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution, long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact, frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables (i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii) long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding $300$ slices without additional memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40\\% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75\\% and halves FVD compared to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically consistent $512\\times512\\times241$ volumes. These results confirm that precise three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging.

In this work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm (\"ridge-less\") linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers) applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named *Randomly Random Mask AutoEncoding* (**R²MAE**), which enforces capturing multi-scale features from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our linear model framework. We implement R²MAE in vision, language, DNA sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard and more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for state-of-the-art models.

To address these challenges, we propose DAAC (Discrepancy-Aware Adaptive Contrastive learning), a learnable multi-view contrastive framework that integrates external normal samples and enhances feature learning through adaptive contrastive strategies. DAAC consists of two key modules: (1) a Discrepancy Estimator, built upon a GAN-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture, captures the distribution of normal data and computes reconstruction errors as indicators of abnormality. These discrepancy features augment the target dataset to mitigate overfitting. (2) an Adaptive Contrastive Learner uses multi-head attention to extract discriminative representations by contrasting embeddings across multiple views and data granularities (subject, trial, epoch, and temporal levels), eliminating the need for handcrafted positive-negative sample pairs. Extensive experiments on three clinical datasets—covering Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and myocardial infarction—demonstrate that DAAC significantly outperforms existing methods, even when only 10\\% of labeled data is available, showing strong generalization and diagnostic performance.

    "abstract": "Real-time decoding of target variables from multiple simultaneously recorded neural time-series modalities, such as discrete spiking activity and continuous field potentials, is important across various neuroscience applications. However, a major challenge for doing so is that different neural modalities can have different timescales (i.e., sampling rates) and different probabilistic distributions, or can even be missing at some time-steps. Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not address different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Further, some of these models do not allow for real-time decoding. Here, we develop a learning framework that can enable real-time recursive decoding while nonlinearly aggregating information across multiple modalities with different timescales and distributions and with missing samples. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly aggregates information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples in real time, 2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time recursive decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities. In both simulations and three distinct multiscale brain datasets, we show that our model can aggregate information across modalities with different timescales and distributions and missing samples to improve real-time target decoding. Further, our method outperforms various linear and nonlinear multimodal benchmarks in doing so.",

However, learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that can efficiently model its angular–spatial structure while remaining physically grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions. First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View Modeling for Light Fields (MVM-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and their PSF-based forward projections.

Current methods, often linear and reliant on summary statistics, fail to capture complex genetic interactions and discard valuable individual-level information. We introduce **PRSformer**, a scalable deep learning architecture designed for end-to-end, multitask disease prediction directly from million-scale individual genotypes.  PRSformer employs neighborhood attention, achieving linear $O(L)$ complexity per layer, making Transformers tractable for genome-scale inputs. Crucially, PRSformer utilizes a stacking of these efficient attention layers, progressively increasing the effective receptive field to model local dependencies (e.g., within linkage disequilibrium blocks) before integrating information across wider genomic regions. This design, tailored for genomics, allows PRSformer to learn complex, potentially non-linear and long-range interactions directly from raw genotypes. We demonstrate PRSformer's effectiveness using a unique large private cohort ($N \\approx 5$M) for predicting 18 autoimmune and inflammatory conditions using $L \\approx 140$k variants. PRSformer significantly outperforms highly optimized linear models trained on the *same individual-level data* and state-of-the-art summary-statistic-based methods (LDPred2) derived from the *same cohort*, quantifying the benefits of non-linear modeling and multitask learning at scale. Furthermore, experiments reveal that the advantage of non-linearity emerges primarily at large sample sizes ($N > 1$M), and that a multi-ancestry trained model improves generalization, establishing PRSformer as a new framework for deep learning in population-scale genomics.",

Although recent generative approaches, particularly diffusion-based models, have shown promising results, they require iterative sampling to generate candidate structures and depend on separate scoring functions for pose selection. This leads to an inefficient pipeline that is difficult to scale in real-world drug discovery workflows. To overcome these challenges, we introduce FIGRDock, a fast and accurate flexible docking framework that understands complicated interactions between molecules and proteins with a regression-based approach. FIGRDock leverages initial docking poses from conventional tools to distill interaction-aware distance patterns, which serve as explicit structural conditions to directly guide the prediction of the final protein-ligand complex via a regression model. This one-shot inference paradigm enables rapid and precise pose prediction without reliance on multi-step sampling or external scoring stages. Experimental results show that FIGRDock achieves up to 100× faster inference than diffusion-based docking methods, while consistently surpassing them in accuracy across standard benchmarks. These results suggest that FIGRDock has the potential to offer a scalable and efficient solution for flexible docking, advancing the pace of structure-based drug discovery.",

In this work, we introduce a novel hierarchical autoregressive framework for modeling protein dynamics that leverages the intrinsic multi-scale organization of molecular motions. Unlike existing methods that focus on generating static conformational ensembles or treat dynamic sampling as an independent process, our approach characterizes protein dynamics as a Markovian process. The framework employs a two-scale architecture: a low-resolution model captures slow, collective motions driving major conformational transitions, while a high-resolution model generates detailed local fluctuations conditioned on these large-scale movements. This hierarchical design ensures that the causal dependencies inherent in protein dynamics are preserved, enabling the generation of temporally coherent and physically realistic trajectories. By bridging high-level biophysical principles with state-of-the-art generative modeling, our approach provides an efficient framework for simulating protein dynamics that balances computational efficiency with physical accuracy.",

We introduce generative distribution embeddings (GDE), a framework that lifts autoencoders to the space of distributions. In GDEs, an encoder acts on sets of samples, and the decoder is replaced by a generator which aims to match the input distribution. This framework enables learning representations of distributions by coupling conditional generative models with encoder networks which satisfy a criterion we call distributional invariance. We show that GDEs learn predictive sufficient statistics embedded in the Wasserstein space, such that latent GDE distances approximately recover the $W_2$ distance, and latent interpolation approximately recovers optimal transport trajectories for Gaussian and Gaussian mixture distributions. We systematically benchmark GDEs against existing approaches on synthetic datasets, demonstrating consistently stronger performance. We then apply GDEs to six key problems in computational biology: learning donor-level representations from single-nuclei RNA sequencing data (6M cells), capturing clonal dynamics in lineage-traced RNA sequencing data (150K cells), predicting perturbation effects on transcriptomes (1M cells), predicting perturbation effects on cellular phenotypes (20M single-cell images), designing synthetic yeast promoters (34M sequences), and spatiotemporal modeling of viral protein sequences (1M sequences).",

This paper introduces orthogonal contrastive learning (OCL), a unified multi-representation framework for multi-subject fMRI analysis that aligns neural responses without requiring temporal preprocessing or uniform time-series lengths across subjects or sites. OCL employs two identical encoders: an online network trained with a contrastive loss that pulls together same-stimulus responses and pushes apart different-stimulus responses, and a target network whose weights track the online network via exponential moving average to stabilize learning. Each OCL network layer combines QR decomposition for orthogonal feature extraction, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to produce compact subject-specific signatures, positional encoding to embed temporal structure alongside spatial features, and a transformer encoder to generate discriminative, stimulus-aligned embeddings. We further enhance OCL with an unsupervised pretraining stage on fMRI-like synthetic data and demonstrate a transfer-learning workflow for multi-site studies. Across extensive experiments on multi-subject and multi-site fMRI benchmarks, OCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alignment and analysis methods in both representation quality and downstream classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to possess comprehensive medical knowledge to support real-world clinical applications. While domain-specific fine-tuning effectively injects medical knowledge into LLMs, it often causes catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge and instruction-following capabilities. In this paper, we investigate this issue and reveal a pattern of proximity-dependent forgetting: knowledge that is semantically or topically close to the injected content is more likely to be forgotten, while unrelated knowledge shows minimal degradation. Moreover, we observe that existing mitigation techniques fail to address this type of forgetting effectively. Motivated by this observation and inspired by human learning mechanisms, we proposeInternAL (\\Internal Knowledge Augmentation Learning), a novel approach that leverages LLMs' own internal knowledge to mitigate forgetting. InternAL first probes internal knowledge closely related to the injection by prompting the model with questions derived from the injected knowledge. This knowledge is then used to augment the original injection dataset, guiding the model to retain related prior knowledge during training. Experimental results on multiple LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen) demonstrate that InternAL significantly mitigates proximity-related forgetting while maintaining strong knowledge injection performance. Our findings provide new insights into the nature of catastrophic forgetting in medical knowledge injection and highlight a promising direction for robust domain adaptation in LLMs. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/THUMLP/InternAL.",

However, applying DiTs to molecules introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off between between accuracy and computational efficiency.\nExperiments on standard conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative modeling of molecular structures.

    "abstract": "Predicting the bioactivity of candidate ligands remains a central challenge in drug discovery. Ligands and endogenous substrates often compete for the same binding sites on target proteins, and the extent to which a ligand can modulate protein function depends not only on its binding but also on how effectively it occupies the relevant pocket. However, most existing methods focus narrowly on local interactions within protein–ligand complexes and neglect spatial emptiness—the unoccupied regions within the binding site that may permit endogenous molecules to engage or interfere. Such unfilled space can diminish the ligand’s functional impact, regardless of binding affinity. To overcome this key limitation in protein–ligand modeling, we propose LigoSpace, a novel method integrating three core components. LigoSpace introduces GeoREC (Geometric Representation of Spatial Emptiness in Complexes) to quantify atomic-level empty space and Union-Pocket to unify multiple protein pockets, providing a global view of binding sites. Additionally, LigoSpace employs a pairwise loss instead of commonly used MSE loss, to better capture relative relationships critical for drug discovery. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with diverse bioactivity types demonstrate that LigoSpace significantly improves performance when integrated into state-of-the-art models, highlighting the effectiveness of its novel components.",

    "abstract": "Model-based clustering integrated with variable selection is a powerful tool for uncovering latent structures within complex data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered by challenges such as identifying relevant variables that define heterogeneous subgroups and handling data that are missing not at random, a prevalent issue in fields like transcriptomics. While several notable methods have been proposed to address these problems, they typically tackle each issue in isolation, thereby limiting their flexibility and adaptability. This paper introduces a unified framework designed to address these challenges simultaneously. Our approach incorporates a data-driven penalty matrix into penalized clustering to enable more flexible variable selection, along with a mechanism that explicitly models the relationship between missingness and latent class membership. We demonstrate that, under certain regularity conditions, the proposed framework achieves both asymptotic consistency and selection consistency, even in the presence of missing data. This unified strategy significantly enhances the capability and efficiency of model-based clustering, advancing methodologies for identifying informative variables that define homogeneous subgroups in the presence of complex missing data patterns. The performance of the framework, including its computational efficiency, is evaluated through simulations and demonstrated using both synthetic and real-world transcriptomic datasets.",

    "abstract": "Paucity of medical data severely limits the generalizability of diagnostic ML models, as the full spectrum of disease variability can not be represented by a small clinical dataset. To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and augmentation. However, they frequently produce _medically inaccurate_ images, deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities, making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel framework, coined MAGIC (**M**edically **A**ccurate **G**eneration of **I**mages through AI-Expert **C**ollaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload. Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting. Beyond image synthesis, MAGIC illustrates a task-centric alignment paradigm: instead of adapting MLLMs to niche medical tasks, it adapts tasks to the evaluative strengths of general-purpose MLLMs by decomposing domain knowledge into attribute-level checklists. This design offers a scalable and reliable path for leveraging foundation models in specialized domains.",

Here, we introduce Ctrl-DNA, a novel constrained reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for designing regulatory DNA sequences with controllable cell-type specificity. By formulating regulatory sequence design as a biologically informed constrained optimization problem, we apply RL to autoregressive genomic LMs, enabling the models to iteratively refine sequences that maximize regulatory activity in targeted cell types while constraining off-target effects. Our evaluation on human promoters and enhancers demonstrates that Ctrl-DNA consistently outperforms existing generative and RL-based approaches, generating high-fitness regulatory sequences and achieving state-of-the-art cell-type specificity. Moreover, Ctrl-DNA-generated sequences capture key cell-type-specific transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), short DNA motifs recognized by regulatory proteins that control gene expression, demonstrating the biological plausibility of the generated sequences.",

We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance on texture.

    "abstract": "A major goal of neuroscience is to understand brain computations during visual processing in naturalistic settings. A dominant approach is to use image-computable deep neural networks trained with different task objectives as a basis for linear encoding models. However, in addition to requiring estimation of a large number of linear encoding parameters, this approach ignores the structure of the feature maps both in the brain and the models. Recently proposed alternatives  factor the linear mapping into separate sets of spatial and feature weights, thus finding static receptive fields for units, which is appropriate only for early visual areas. In this work, we employ the attention mechanism used in the transformer architecture to study how retinotopic visual features can be dynamically routed to category-selective areas in high-level visual processing. We show that this computational motif is significantly more powerful than alternative methods in predicting brain activity during natural scene viewing, across different feature basis models and modalities. We also show that this approach is inherently more interpretable as the attention-routing signals for different high-level categorical areas can be easily visualized for any input image. Given its high performance at predicting brain responses to novel images, the model deserves consideration as a candidate mechanistic model of how visual information from retinotopic maps is routed in the human brain based on the relevance of the input content to different category-selective regions.

Recent work shows that mild label noise in these corpora may lift in-distribution accuracy yet sharply reduce out-of-distribution generalization, an effect known as catastrophic inheritance. Medical data is especially sensitive because annotations are scarce, domain shifts are large, and pretraining sources are noisy.\nWe present the first systematic analysis of catastrophic inheritance in medical models. Controlled label-corruption experiments expose a clear structural collapse: as noise rises, the skewness and kurtosis of feature and logit distributions decline, signaling a flattened representation space and diminished discriminative detail. These higher-order statistics form a compact, interpretable marker of degradation in fine-grained tasks such as histopathology.\nGuided by this finding, we introduce a fine-tuning objective that restores skewness and kurtosis through two scalar regularizers added to the task loss. The method leaves the backbone unchanged and incurs negligible overhead. Tests on PLIP models trained with Twitter pathology images, as well as other large-scale vision and language backbones, show consistent gains in robustness and cross-domain accuracy under varied noise levels.",

While recent models of population activity emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural forecasting—particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings—remains underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and *C. elegans*, POCO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors. After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically meaningful structure—such as brain region clustering—without any anatomical labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing. Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel conformal prediction framework for constructing conformal prediction bands with high probability around biomarker trajectories observed at subject-specific, randomly-timed follow-up visits. Existing conformal methods typically assume fixed time grids, limiting their applicability in longitudinal clinical studies. Our approach addresses this limitation by defining a time-varying nonconformity score that normalizes prediction errors using model-derived uncertainty estimates, enabling conformal inference at arbitrary time points. We evaluate our method on two well-established brain biomarkers—hippocampal and ventricular volume—using a range of standard and state-of-the-art predictors. Across models, our conformalized predictors consistently achieve nominal coverage with tighter prediction intervals compared to baseline uncertainty estimates. To further account for population heterogeneity, we develop group-conditional conformal bands with formal coverage guarantees across clinically relevant and high-risk subgroups. Finally, we demonstrate the clinical utility of our approach in identifying subjects at risk of progression to Alzheimer’s disease. We introduce an uncertainty-aware progression metric based on the lower conformal bound and show that it enables the identification of 17.5\\% more high-risk subjects compared to standard slope-based methods, highlighting the value of uncertainty calibration in real-world clinical decision making.

    "abstract": "Pathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis is vital for disease diagnosis and understanding. While foundation models (FMs) have driven recent advances, their scalability in pathology remains a key challenge. In particular, vision-language (VL) pathology FMs align visual features with language annotation for downstream tasks, but they rely heavily on large-scale image-text paired data, which is scarce thus limiting generalization. On the other hand, vision-only pathology FMs can leverage abundant unlabeled data via self-supervised learning (SSL). However, current approaches often use the [CLS] token from tile-level ViTs as slide-level input for efficiency (a tile with 224×224 pixels composed of 196 patches with 16×16 pixels). This SSL pretrained [CLS] token lacks alignment with downstream objectives, limiting effectiveness. We find that spatial patch tokens retain a wealth of informative features beneficial for downstream tasks, but utilizing all of them incurs up to 200× higher computation and storage costs compared [CLS] token only (e.g., 196 tokens per ViT$_{224}$). This highlights a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and representational richness to build scalable pathology FMs. To address this, we propose a feature distillation framework via vector-quantization (VQ) that compresses patch tokens into discrete indices and reconstructs them via a decoder, achieving 64× compression (1024 → 16 dimensions) while preserving fidelity. We further introduce a multi-scale VQ (MSVQ) strategy, enhancing both reconstruction and providing SSL supervision for slide-level pretraining. Built upon MSVQ features and supervision signals, we design a progressive convolutional module and a slide-level SSL objective to learn spatially rich representations for downstream WSI tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a scalable and effective solution for high-performing pathology FMs in WSI analysis.",

Inspired by this biological principle, we propose SPICED: a neuromorphic framework that integrates the synaptic homeostasis mechanism for unsupervised continual EEG decoding, particularly addressing practical scenarios where new individuals with inter-individual variability emerge continually. SPICED comprises a novel synaptic network that enables dynamic expansion during continual adaptation through three bio-inspired neural mechanisms: (1) critical memory reactivation, which mimics brain functional specificity, selectively activates task-relevant memories to facilitate adaptation; (2) synaptic consolidation, which strengthens these reactivated critical memory traces and enhances their replay prioritizations for further adaptations and (3) synaptic renormalization, which are periodically triggered to weaken global memory traces to preserve learning capacities. The interplay within synaptic homeostasis dynamically strengthens  task-discriminative memory traces and weakens detrimental memories. By integrating these mechanisms with continual learning system, SPICED preferentially replays task-discriminative memory traces that exhibit strong associations with newly emerging individuals, thereby achieving robust adaptations. Meanwhile, SPICED effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting by suppressing the replay prioritization of detrimental memories during long-term continual learning. Validated on three EEG datasets, SPICED show its effectiveness. More importantly, SPICED bridges biological neural mechanisms and artificial intelligence through synaptic homeostasis, providing insights into the broader applicability of bio-inspired principles.",

To address these limitations, we propose a novel denoising framework AniDS: Anisotropic Variational Autoencoder for 3D Molecular Denoising. AniDS introduces a structure-aware anisotropic noise generator that can produce atom-specific, full covariance matrices for Gaussian noise distributions to better reflect directional and structural variability in molecular systems. These covariances are derived from pairwise atomic interactions as anisotropic corrections to an isotropic base. Our design ensures that the resulting covariance matrices are symmetric, positive semi-definite, and SO(3)-equivariant, while providing greater capacity to model complex molecular dynamics. Extensive experiments show that AniDS outperforms prior isotropic and homoscedastic denoising models and other leading methods on the MD17 and OC22 benchmarks, achieving average relative improvements of 8.9% and 6.2% in force prediction accuracy. Our case study on a crystal and molecule structure shows that AniDS adaptively suppresses noise along the bonding direction, consistent with physicochemical principles.

In our framework, segmentation masks are parameterized as continuous probability fields of learnable 2D Gaussian primitives, enforcing spatially smooth and structurally consistent. Contourlet transforms extract rich multidirectional frequency information, notably edges and fine textures, which dynamically guide the spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives to substantially improve boundary fidelity in complex structures. The incorporation of these high-frequency contour priors also enriches the expressive capacity of the SAM image encoder.

However, current methods predominantly rely on subject-speciﬁc models or require subject-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the ﬁrst zero-shot brain visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-speciﬁc adaptation. Z EBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to isolate subject-invariant, semantic-speciﬁc representations. This disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA signiﬁcantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance comparable to fully ﬁnetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.",

Early approaches rely exclusively on gene expression data, thus their predictive power remain fundamentally constrained by the vast combinatorial space of potential gene-gene interactions. Subsequent methods integrate prior knowledge to mitigate this challenge by restricting the solution space to biologically plausible interactions. However, we argue that the effectiveness of these approaches is contingent upon the precision of prior information and the reduction in the search space will circumscribe the models' potential for novel biological discoveries. To address these limitations, we introduce KINDLE, a three-stage framework that decouples GRN inference from prior knowledge dependencies. KINDLE trains a teacher model that integrates prior knowledge with temporal gene expression dynamics and subsequently distills this encoded knowledge to a student model, enabling accurate GRN inference solely from expression data without access to any prior. KINDLE achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmark datasets. Notably, it successfully identifies key transcription factors governing mouse embryonic development and precisely characterizes their functional roles. In mouse hematopoietic stem cell data, KINDLE accurately predicts fate transition outcomes following knockout of two critical regulators (Gata1 and Spi1). These biological validations demonstrate our framework's dual capability in maintaining topological inference precision while preserving discovery potential for novel biological mechanisms.",

Existing task-general pre-training EEG models struggle with complex tasks like emotion recognition due to mismatches between task-specific features and broad pre-training approaches. This work aims to develop a task-specific multi-dataset joint pre-training framework for cross-dataset emotion recognition, tackling problems of large inter-dataset distribution shifts, inconsistent emotion category definitions, and substantial inter-subject variability. We introduce a cross-dataset covariance alignment loss to align second-order statistical properties across datasets, enabling robust generalization without the need for extensive labels or per-subject calibration. To capture the long-term dependency and complex dynamics of EEG, we propose a hybrid encoder combining a Mamba-like linear attention channel encoder and a spatiotemporal dynamics model. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art large-scale EEG models by an average of 4.57% in AUROC for few-shot emotion recognition and 11.92% in accuracy for zero-shot generalization to a new dataset. Performance scales with the increase of datasets used in pre-training. Multi-dataset joint pre-training achieves a performance gain of 8.55\\% over single-dataset training. This work provides a scalable framework for task-specific pre-training and highlights its benefit in generalizable affective computing.

However, in current mediation analysis, complex structures derived from causal discovery lack direct interpretation of mediation pathways, while traditional mediation analysis and effect estimation are limited by the reliance on pre-specified pathways, leading to a disconnection between structure discovery and causal mechanism understanding. Therefore, a unified framework integrating structure discovery, pathway identification, and effect estimation systematically quantifies mediation pathways under structural uncertainty, enabling automated identification and inference of mediation pathways. To this end, we propose Structure-Informed Guided Mediation Analysis (SIGMA), which guides automated mediation pathway identification through probabilistic causal structure discovery and uncertainty quantification, enabling end-to-end propagation of structural uncertainty from structure learning to effect estimation. Specifically, SIGMA employs differentiable Flow-Structural Equation Models to learn structural posteriors, generating diverse Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to quantify structural uncertainty. Based on these DAGs, we introduce the Path Stability Score to evaluate the marginal probability of pathways, identifying high-confidence mediation paths. For identified mediation pathways, we integrate Efficient Influence Functions with Bayesian model averaging to fuse within-structure estimation uncertainty and between-structure effect variation, propagating uncertainty to the final effect estimates. In synthetic data experiments, SIGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in pathway identification accuracy and effect quantification precision under structures uncertainty, concurrent multiple pathways, and nonlinear scenarios. In real-world applications using Human Phenotype Project data, SIGMA identifies mediation effects of sleep quality on cardiovascular health through inflammatory and metabolic pathways, uncovering previously unspecified multiple mediation paths.",

Advances in large-scale longitudinal EHRs have enabled learning-based approaches that leverage patient histories such as diagnoses, procedures, and previously prescribed drugs, to model complex patient-drug relationships. Yet, many existing solutions overlook standard clinical practices that favor certain drugs for specific conditions and fail to fully integrate the influence of molecular substructures on drug efficacy and safety. In response, we propose \\textbf{SubRec}, a unified framework that integrates representation learning across both patient and drug spaces. Specifically, SubRec introduces a conditional information bottleneck to extract core drug substructures most relevant to patient conditions, thereby enhancing interpretability and clinical alignment. Meanwhile, an adaptive vector quantization mechanism is designed to generate patient–drug interaction patterns into a condition-aware codebook which reuses clinically meaningful patterns, reduces training overhead, and provides a controllable latent space for recommendation. Crucially, the synergy between condition-specific substructure learning and discrete patient prototypes allows SubRec to make accurate and personalized drug recommendations. Experimental results on the real-world MIMIC III and IV demonstrate our model's advantages.  \nThe source code is available at \\href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DrugRecommendation-5173}{https://anonymous.4open.science/}.",

    "abstract": "In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations essential for reliable downstream analysis.

However, designing diverse and physically realistic protein structure and surfaces that precisely complement target receptors remains a significant challenge in computational protein design. In this work, we introduce PepBridge, a novel framework for the joint design of protein surface and structure that seamlessly integrates receptor surface geometry and biochemical properties. Starting with a receptor surface represented as a 3D point cloud, PepBridge generates complete protein structures through a multi-step process. First, it employs denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) to map receptor surfaces to ligand surfaces. Next, a multi-model diffusion model predicts the corresponding structure, while Shape-Frame Matching Networks ensure alignment between surface geometry and backbone architecture. This integrated approach facilitates surface complementarity, conformational stability, and chemical feasibility. Extensive validation across diverse protein design scenarios demonstrates PepBridge's efficacy in generating structurally viable proteins, representing a significant advancement in the joint design of top-down protein structure.",

Yet it remains unclear whether PLMs can reason about evolution—that is, infer evolutionary relationships between sequences. We test this capability by evaluating whether standard PLM usage, frozen or fine-tuned embeddings with distance-based comparison, supports evolutionary reasoning. Existing PLMs consistently fail to recover phylogenetic structure, despite strong performance on sequence-level tasks such as masked-token and contact prediction. We present Phyla, a hybrid state-space and transformer model that jointly processes multiple sequences and is trained using a tree-based objective across 3,000 phylogenies spanning diverse protein families. Phyla outperforms the next-best PLM by 9\\% on tree reconstruction and 23\\% on taxonomic clustering while remaining alignment- and guide-tree-free. Although classical alignment pipelines achieve higher absolute accuracy, Phyla narrows the gap and achieves markedly lower end-to-end runtime. Applied to real data, Phyla reconstructs biologically accurate clades in the tree of life and resolves genome-scale relationships among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. These findings suggest that, under standard usage, evolutionary reasoning does not reliably emerge from large-scale sequence modeling. Instead, Phyla shows that models trained with phylogenetic supervision can reason about evolution more effectively, offering a biologically grounded path toward evolutionary foundation models.",

The negative curvature and exponentially growing distance metric provide a natural framework for capturing hierarchical relationships between datapoints and allowing for finer separability between their embeddings. However, current hyperbolic learning approaches are still prone to overfitting, computationally expensive, and prone to instability, especially when attempting to learn the manifold curvature to adapt to tasks and different datasets. To address these issues, our paper presents a derivation for Riemannian AdamW that helps increase hyperbolic generalization ability. For improved stability, we introduce a novel fine-tunable hyperbolic scaling approach to constrain hyperbolic embeddings and reduce approximation errors. Using this along with our curvature-aware learning schema for Riemannian Optimizers enables the combination of curvature and non-trivialized hyperbolic parameter learning. Our approach demonstrates consistent performance improvements across Computer Vision, EEG classification, and hierarchical metric learning tasks while greatly reducing runtime.",

Recent advances in neural recording technology with high-density probes and arrays enable dense sampling of extracellular voltage from many sites surrounding a neuron, allowing indirect measurement of many compartments of a cell simultaneously. Here, we propose a method for inferring the underlying membrane voltage, biophysical parameters, and the neuron's position relative to the probe, using extracellular measurements alone.

Classical studies using designed experiments have identified multiple category-selective regions; however, these approaches rely on preconceived hypotheses about categories. Subsequent data-driven discovery methods have sought to address this limitation but are often limited by simple, typically linear encoding models. We propose an in silico approach for data-driven discovery of novel category-selectivity hypotheses based on an encoder–decoder transformer model. The architecture incorporates a brain-region to image-feature cross-attention mechanism, enabling nonlinear mappings between high-dimensional deep network features and semantic patterns encoded in the brain activity. We further introduce a method to characterize the selectivity of individual parcels by leveraging diffusion-based image generative models and large-scale datasets to synthesize and select images that maximally activate each parcel. Our approach reveals regions with complex, compositional selectivity involving diverse semantic concepts, which we validate in silico both within and across subjects. Using a brain encoder as a “digital twin” offers a powerful, data-driven framework for generating and testing hypotheses about visual selectivity in the human brain—hypotheses that can guide future fMRI experiments.

While posterior sampling methods for continuous diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress, analogous methods for discrete diffusion models remain challenging.

Our algorithm enables reward-guided generation and solving inverse problems in discrete-state spaces. We demonstrate the convergence of SGDD to the target posterior distribution and verify this through controlled experiments on synthetic benchmarks. Our method enjoys state-of-the-art posterior sampling performance on a range of benchmarks for discrete data, including DNA sequence design, discrete image inverse problems, and music infilling, achieving more than 30% improved performance compared to existing baselines.",

To address this challenge, we propose Motion-Primitive Transformer (MoPFormer), a novel self-supervised framework that enhances interpretability by tokenizing inertial measurement unit signals into semantically meaningful motion primitives and leverages a Transformer architecture to learn rich temporal representations. MoPFormer comprises two stages. The first stage is to partition multi-channel sensor streams into short segments and quantize them into discrete ``motion primitive'' codewords, while the second stage enriches those tokenized sequences through a context-aware embedding module and then processes them with a Transformer encoder. The proposed MoPFormer can be pre-trained using a masked motion-modeling objective that reconstructs missing primitives, enabling it to develop robust representations across diverse sensor configurations. Experiments on six HAR benchmarks demonstrate that MoPFormer not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also successfully generalizes across multiple datasets. More importantly, the learned motion primitives significantly enhance both interpretability and cross-dataset performance by capturing fundamental movement patterns that remain consistent across similar activities, regardless of dataset origin.",

We propose **Recursive Cost Guidance**, a backward policy framework that employs auxiliary machine learning models to approximate synthesis cost and viability. This guidance steers generation toward low-cost synthesis pathways, significantly enhancing cost-efficiency, molecular diversity, and quality, especially when paired with an **Exploitation Penalty** that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.

Despite the growing interest in multivariate time series analysis, existing methods for between-clusters dependence typically rely on the assumption of stationarity and lack the temporal resolution to capture transient, frequency-specific interactions. To overcome this limitation, we propose scale-specific wavelet canonical coherence (WaveCanCoh), a novel framework that extends canonical coherence analysis to the nonstationary setting by leveraging the multivariate locally stationary wavelet model. The proposed WaveCanCoh enables the estimation of time-varying canonical coherence between clusters, providing interpretable insight into scale-specific time-varying interactions between clusters. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that WaveCanCoh accurately recovers true coherence structures under both locally stationary and general nonstationary conditions. Application to local field potential (LFP) activity data recorded from the hippocampus reveals distinct dynamic coherence patterns between correct and incorrect memory-guided decisions, illustrating capacity of the method to detect behaviorally relevant neural coordination. These results highlight WaveCanCoh as a flexible and principled tool for modeling complex cross-group dependencies in nonstationary multivariate systems.

By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(| \\mathcal{E}|)$ to  $O(| \\mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance.\nWe show that this approach achieves a 7x–30x speedup compared to conventional $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions.

Interestingly, similar to the shared multilingual embedding space of pretrained multilingual language models, human studies provide strong evidence for a shared semantic system in bilingual individuals. Here, we investigate whether fine-tuning language models with bilingual brain data changes model representations in a way that improves them across multiple languages. To test this, we fine-tune monolingual and multilingual language models using brain activity recorded while bilingual participants read stories in English and Chinese. We then evaluate how well these representations generalize to the bilingual participants’ first language, their second language, and several other languages that the participants are not fluent in. We assess the fine-tuned language models on brain encoding performance and downstream NLP tasks. Our results show that bilingual brain-informed fine-tuned language models outperform their vanilla (pretrained) counterparts in both brain encoding performance and most downstream NLP tasks across multiple languages. These findings suggest that brain-informed fine-tuning improves multilingual understanding in language models, offering a bridge between cognitive neuroscience and NLP research.

Existing approaches either rely on pair information or prior correspondences, or require computing a global pairwise coupling matrix, limiting their scalability and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce a scalable and flexible generative framework called single-cell Multi-omics Regularized Disentangled Representations (scMRDR) for unpaired multi-omics integration. Specifically, we disentangle each cell’s latent representations into modality-shared and modality-specific components using a well-designed $\\beta$-VAE architecture, which are augmented with isometric regularization to preserve intra-omics biological heterogeneity, adversarial objective to encourage cross-modal alignment, and masked reconstruction loss strategy to address the issue of missing features across modalities. Our method achieves excellent performance on benchmark datasets in terms of batch correction, modality alignment, and biological signal preservation. Crucially, it scales effectively to large-level datasets and supports integration of more than two omics, offering a powerful and flexible solution for large-scale multi-omics data integration and downstream biological discovery.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence microscopy, while being a key driver for progress in the life sciences, is also subject to technical limitations. To overcome them, computational multiplexing techniques have recently been proposed, which allow multiple cellular structures to be captured in a single image and later be unmixed. Existing image decomposition methods are trained on a set of superimposed input images and the respective unmixed target images. It is critical to note that the relative strength (mixing ratio) of the superimposed images for a given input is a priori unknown. However, existing methods are trained on a fixed intensity ratio of superimposed inputs, making them not cognizant of the range of relative intensities that can occur in fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we propose a novel method called scSplit that is cognizant of the severity of the above-mentioned mixing ratio. Our idea is based on InDI, a popular iterative method for image restoration, and an ideal starting point to embrace the unknown mixing ratio in any given input. We introduce (i) a suitably trained regressor network that predicts the degradation level (mixing asymmetry) of a given input image and (ii) a degradation-specific normalization module, enabling degradation-aware inference across all mixing ratios. We show that this method solves two relevant tasks in fluorescence microscopy, namely image splitting and bleedthrough removal, and empirically demonstrate the applicability of scSplit on 5 public datasets.

This fundamental question is particularly relevant for modern neuroscience, as large-scale electron microscopy now enables the reconstruction of neural circuits at single-synapse resolution across many organisms. To interpret circuit function from such datasets, we must understand the extent to which [measured] structure constrains dynamics. We investigate this question in the drosophila head direction (HD) circuit, which maintains an internal heading estimate through attractor dynamics that integrate self-motion velocity cues. This circuit serves as a sensitive assay for functional specification: continuous attractor networks are theoretically known to require finely tuned wiring, whereas connectomes reveal that biological wiring can be variable and omit key cellular parameters such as synaptic gains, neuronal thresholds, and time constants. \nWe introduce a method that combines self-supervised and unsupervised learning objectives to estimate unknown parameters at the level of cell types, rather than individual neurons and synapses. Given the raw connectivity matrix, our approach recovers a network that robustly exhibits continuous attractor dynamics and accurately integrates a range of velocity inputs, despite  minimal parameter tuning on a connectome which notably departs from the symmetric regularity of an idealized ring attractor. We characterize how deviations from the original connectome shape the space of viable solutions. We also perform in-silico ablation experiments to probe the distinct functional roles of specific cell types in the circuit, demonstrating how connectome-derived structure, when augmented with minimal, biologically grounded tuning, can replicate known physiology and elucidate circuit function.",

This action-only regularization imitates clinician actions that prioritize short-term rewards, but it fails to regulate downstream state trajectories, thereby limiting the discovery of improved long-term treatment strategies. To safely improve policy beyond clinician recommendations while ensuring that state-action trajectories remain in-distribution, we propose \\textit{Offline Guarded Safe Reinforcement Learning} ($\\mathsf{OGSRL}$), a theoretically grounded model-based offline RL framework. $\\mathsf{OGSRL}$ introduces a novel dual constraint mechanism for improving policy with reliability and safety. First, the OOD guardian is established to specify clinically validated regions for safe policy exploration. By constraining optimization within these regions, it enables the reliable exploration of treatment strategies that outperform clinician behavior by leveraging the full patient state history, without drifting into unsupported state-action trajectories. Second, we introduce a safety cost constraint that encodes medical knowledge about physiological safety boundaries, providing domain-specific safeguards even in areas where training data might contain potentially unsafe interventions. Notably, we provide theoretical guarantees on safety and near-optimality: policies that satisfy these constraints remain in safe and reliable regions and achieve performance close to the best possible policy supported by the data. When evaluated on the MIMIC-III sepsis treatment dataset, $\\mathsf{OGSRL}$ demonstrated significantly better OOD handling than baselines. $\\mathsf{OGSRL}$ achieved a 78\\% reduction in mortality estimates and a 51\\% increase in reward compared to clinician decisions.",

However, these models (e.g., diffusion models (DMs)) typically require large amounts of fully sampled (clean) training data, which is often impractical in medical and scientific settings such as dynamic imaging. On the other hand, training-data-free approaches like the Deep Image Prior (DIP) do not require clean ground-truth images but suffer from noise overfitting and can be computationally expensive as the network parameters need to be optimized for each measurement vector independently. Moreover, DIP-based methods often overlook the potential of learning a prior using a small number of sub-sampled measurements (or degraded images) available during training. In this paper, we propose **UGoDIT**—an **U**nsupervised **G**r**o**up **DI**P with **T**ransferable weights—designed for the low-data regime where only a very small number, $M$, of sub-sampled measurement vectors are available during training. Our method learns a set of transferable weights by optimizing a shared encoder and $M$ disentangled decoders. At test time, we reconstruct the unseen degraded image using a DIP network, where part of the parameters are fixed to the learned weights, while the remaining are optimized to enforce measurement consistency. We evaluate \\our on both medical (multi-coil MRI) and natural (super resolution and non-linear deblurring) image recovery tasks under various settings. Compared to recent standalone DIP methods, \\our provides accelerated convergence and notable improvement in reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our method achieves performance competitive with SOTA DM-based and supervised approaches, despite not requiring large amounts of clean training data.

This approach enabled the curation of the largest sensor-language dataset to date, comprising over 59.7 million hours of data from more than 103,000 people. Furthermore, SensorLM extends prominent multimodal pretraining architectures (e.g., CLIP, CoCa) and recovers them as specific variants within a generic architecture. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks in human activity analysis and healthcare verify the superior performance of SensorLM over state-of-the-art in zero-shot recognition, few-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval. SensorLM also demonstrates intriguing capabilities including scaling behaviors, label efficiency, sensor captioning, and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

In this paper, we further investigate the inherent scalability of the framework and propose locally and globally convergent semismooth Newton methods. Despite the nonsmoothness of the problem, these second-order  algorithms converge at a locally quadratic rate, and require only a few tens of iterations in practice.  Each iteration reduces to solving linear systems of small dimensions or linear complementary problems of smaller dimensions, making the computation also suitable for less powerful computing environments. Experiments on both simulated and real-world genomic datasets demonstrate the superior convergence behavior and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which position our method as a promising tool for massive-scale network analysis sought for in, e.g., modern multi-omics research.",

To handle the growing volume of DNA sequence data, Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) have been developed by adapting architectures and training paradigms from Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite their remarkable performance in DNA sequence classification tasks, there remains a lack of systematic understanding regarding the training and task-adaptation processes of GFMs. Moreover, existing GFMs cannot achieve state-of-the-art performance on both short and long-context tasks and lacks multimodal abilities. By revisiting pre-training architectures and post-training techniques, we propose **Omni-DNA**, a family of models spanning 20M to 1.1B parameters that supports sequence understanding, long-context genomic reasoning, and natural-language annotation. **Omni-DNA** establishes new state-of-the-art results on 18 of 26 evaluations drawn from Nucleotide Transformer and Genomic Benchmarks. When jointly fine-tuning on biologically related tasks, **Omni-DNA** consistently outperform existing models and demonstrate multi-tasking abilities.  To enable processing of arbitrary sequence lengths, we introduce **SEQPACK**—an adaptive compression operator that packs historical tokens into a learned synopsis using a position-aware learnable sampling mechanism, enabling transformer-based models to process ultra-long sequences with minimal memory and computational requirements. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on enhancer-target interaction tasks, capturing distant regulatory interactions at the 450kbp range more effectively than existing models. Finally, we present a new dataset termed **seq2func**, enabling Omni-DNA to generate accurate and functionally meaningful interpretations of DNA sequences, unlocking new possibilities for genomic analysis and discovery.",

Notably, even when graph structures are embedded within textual descriptions, LLMs can still effectively answer related questions. This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only Transformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address this, \nwe start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner mechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input queries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis, we present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures the substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further validate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across layers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of Transformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the concept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite patterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully extract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs. Together, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers perform the substructure extraction task over graph data.",

In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is challenged by arduous pipelines to transform raw experimental data into atomic models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling trajectory of a pretrained biomolecular structure prediction model using both global and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data.

We introduce generative property enhancer (GPE), an approach that implicitly guides generation by matching samples with lower property values to higher-value ones. Formulated as conditional density estimation, our framework defines a target distribution with improved properties, compelling the generative model to produce enhanced, diverse designs without auxiliary predictors. GPE is simple, scalable, end-to-end, modality-agnostic, and integrates seamlessly with diverse generative model architectures and losses.

    "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments. Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings. Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative. Because they operate causally (i.e. only on present and past inputs) these models are suitable for real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce **Spikachu: a scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs**. Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input, extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113 recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings. Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using between 2.26× and 418.81× less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall, Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.",

In this paper, we propose joint Velocity-Growth Flow Matching (VGFM), a novel paradigm that jointly learns state transition and mass growth of single-cell populations via flow matching. VGFM builds an ideal single-cell dynamics containing velocity of state and growth of mass, driven by a presented two-period dynamic understanding of the static semi-relaxed optimal transport, a mathematical tool that seeks the coupling between unpaired and unbalanced data. To enable practical usage, we approximate the ideal dynamics using neural networks, forming our joint velocity and growth matching framework. A distribution fitting loss is also employed in VGFM to further improve the fitting performance for snapshot data. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that VGFM can capture the underlying biological dynamics accounting for mass and state variations over time, outperforming existing approaches for single-cell dynamics modeling.",

Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), bridges the gap between: (1) keeping the traceability of individual entities in a latent system representation, and (2) leveraging the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder enable generative modeling directly in latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is the introduction of identifier representations (IDs) that enable the retrieval of entity properties and entity composition from latent system representations, thus fostering traceability.

Existing methods leverage optimal transport, Schrödinger bridge theory, or their variants to simultaneously infer stochastic, unbalanced dynamics from snapshot data. However, these approaches remain limited in their ability to account for cell-cell interactions. This integration is essential in real-world scenarios since intercellular communications are fundamental life processes and can influence cell state-transition dynamics. To address this challenge, we formulate the Unbalanced Mean-Field Schrödinger Bridge (UMFSB) framework to model unbalanced stochastic interaction dynamics from snapshot data. Inspired by this framework, we further propose CytoBridge, a deep learning algorithm designed to approximate the UMFSB problem. By explicitly modeling cellular transitions, proliferation, and interactions through neural networks, CytoBridge offers the flexibility to learn these processes directly from data. The effectiveness of our method has been extensively validated using both synthetic gene regulatory data and real scRNA-seq datasets. Compared to existing methods, CytoBridge identifies growth, transition, and interaction patterns, eliminates false transitions, and reconstructs the developmental landscape with greater accuracy.

Boltzmann Generators address this problem by leveraging continuous normalizing flows to transform a simple prior into a distribution that can be reweighted to match the target using sample likelihoods. Despite the elegance of this approach, obtaining these likelihoods requires computing costly Jacobians during integration, which is impractical for large molecular systems. To overcome this difficulty, we train an energy-based model (EBM) to approximate likelihoods using both noise contrastive estimation (NCE) and score matching, which we show outperforms the use of either objective in isolation. On 2D synthetic systems where failure can be easily visualized, NCE improves mode weighting relative to score matching alone. On alanine dipeptide, our method yields free energy profiles and energy distributions that closely match those obtained using exact likelihoods while achieving $100\\times$ faster inference. By training on multiple dipeptide systems, we show that our approach also exhibits effective transfer learning, generalizing to new systems at inference time and achieving at least a $6\\times$ speedup over standard MD with only a bit of fine-tuning. While many recent efforts in generative modeling have prioritized models with fast sampling, our work demonstrates the design of models with accelerated likelihoods, enabling the application of reweighting schemes that ensure unbiased Boltzmann statistics at scale.

Due to the challenges of imaging pathology spreading flows *in vivo*, however, quantitative analysis on the cortical pathways of tau propagation and its interaction with the cascade of amyloid-beta (A$\\beta$) plaques lags behind the experimental insights of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. To address this challenge, we present a physics-informed neural network, empowered by mean-field theory, to uncover the biologically meaningful spreading pathways of tau aggregates between two longitudinal snapshots. Following the notion of `prion-like' mechanism in AD, we first formulate the dynamics of tau propagation as a mean-field game (MFG), where the spread of tau aggregate at each location (aka. agent) depends on the collective behavior of the surrounding agents as well as the potential field formed by amyloid burden. Given the governing equation of propagation dynamics, MFG reaches an equilibrium that allows us to model the evolution of tau aggregates as an optimal transport with the lowest cost in *Wasserstein* space. By leveraging the variational primal-dual structure in MFG, we propose a *Wasserstein*-1 Lagrangian generative adversarial network (GAN), in which a Lipschitz critic seeks the appropriate transport cost at the population level and a generator parameterizes the flow fields of optimal transport across individuals. Additionally, we incorporate a symbolic regression module to derive an explicit formulation capturing the A$\\beta$-tau crosstalk. Experimental results on public neuroimaging datasets demonstrate that our explainable deep model not only yields precise and reliable predictions of future tau progression for unseen new subjects but also provides a new window to uncover new understanding of pathology propagation in AD through learning-based approaches.",

Although these approaches have shown promise, they struggle to scale in more demanding scenarios where energy evaluations are expensive and the sampling space is high-dimensional. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable and sample-efficient framework that properly harmonizes the powerful classical sampling method and the diffusion sampler. Specifically, we utilize Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) samplers with a novelty-based auxiliary energy as a Searcher to collect off-policy samples, using an auxiliary energy function to compensate for exploring modes the diffusion sampler rarely visits. These off-policy samples are then combined with on-policy data to train the diffusion sampler, thereby expanding its coverage of the energy landscape. Furthermore, we identify primacy bias, i.e., the preference of samplers for early experience during training, as the main cause of mode collapse during training, and introduce a periodic re-initialization trick to resolve this issue. Our method significantly improves sample efficiency on standard benchmarks for diffusion samplers and also excels at higher-dimensional problems and real-world molecular conformer generation.",

Existing reinforcement learning approaches to exploration in reward-free environments, including a class of methods known as *model-based intrinsic motivation*, exhibit inconsistent exploration patterns and do not converge to an exploratory policy, thus failing to capture robust autonomous behaviors observed in animals. Moreover, systems neuroscience has largely overlooked the neural basis of autonomy, focusing instead on experimental paradigms where animals are motivated by external reward rather than engaging in ethological, naturalistic and task-independent behavior. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel model-based intrinsic drive explicitly designed after the principles of autonomous exploration in animals. Our method (3M-Progress) achieves animal-like exploration by tracking divergence between an online world model and a fixed prior learned from an ecological niche. To the best of our knowledge, we introduce the first autonomous embodied agent that predicts brain data entirely from self-supervised optimization of an intrinsic goal—without any behavioral or neural training data—demonstrating that 3M-Progress agents capture the explainable variance in behavioral patterns and whole-brain neural-glial dynamics recorded from autonomously behaving larval zebrafish, thereby providing the first goal-driven, population-level model of neural-glial computation. Our findings establish a computational framework connecting model-based intrinsic motivation to naturalistic behavior, providing a foundation for building artificial agents with animal-like autonomy.",

    "abstract": "Biological function arises through the dynamical interactions of multiple subsystems, including those between brain areas, within gene regulatory networks, and more. A common approach to understanding these systems is to model the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between them. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the subsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the directionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between subsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically linear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by nonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven nonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions via the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning Jacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning method that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for arbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODE models outperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems, including high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we show that the “sensory” area gains greater control over the “cognitive” area over learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the trained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior. Our work lays the foundation for a theoretically grounded and data-driven understanding of interactions among biological subsystems.",

Considering the unique nature of the causal discovery field, which focuses on extracting causal graphs from observed data, research on LLMs in this field is still at an early exploratory stage. As a subfield of causal discovery, effective connectivity (EC) has received even less attention, and LLM-based approaches in EC remain unexplored. Existing LLM-based approaches for causal discovery typically rely on iterative querying to assess the causal influence between variable pairs, without any model adaptation or fine-tuning, making them ill-suited for handling the cross-modal gap and complex causal structures. To this end, we propose BrainEC-LLM, the first method to fine-tune LLMs for estimating brain EC from fMRI data. Specifically, multiscale decomposition mixing module decomposes fMRI time series data into short-term and long-term multiscale trends, then mixing them in bottom-up (fine to coarse) and top-down (coarse to fine) manner to extract multiscale temporal variations. And cross attention is applied with pre-trained word embeddings to ensure consistency between the fMRI input and pre-trained natural language. The experimental results on simulated and real resting-state fMRI datasets demonstrate that BrainEC-LLM can achieve superior performance when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

In this work, we propose a flow matching model for sampling protein conformations based solely on backbone geometry - BBFlow. We introduce a geometric encoding of the backbone equilibrium structure as input and propose to condition not only the flow but also the prior distribution on the respective equilibrium structure, eliminating the need for evolutionary information. The resulting model is orders of magnitudes faster than current state-of-the-art approaches at comparable accuracy, is transferable to multi-chain proteins, and can be trained from scratch in a few GPU days. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance with reduced inference time, across not only an established benchmark of naturally occurring proteins but also de novo proteins, for which evolutionary information is scarce or absent.

This, in turn, poses a challenge for deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500 neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research.

At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data. Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This represents a step toward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on domain-specific data.",

However, structure elucidation from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra. While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals.\nTo address this, we propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed fingerprint–molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the reference structure.\nExtensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's effectiveness and robustness.\nWe provide the data and code at [https://github.com/OpenDFM/MS-BART](https://github.com/OpenDFM/MS-BART).",

Beyond direct sampling, the score of such a model can also be used to derive the forces that act on molecular systems. However, while classical diffusion sampling usually recovers the training distribution, the corresponding energy-based interpretation of the learned score is often inconsistent with this distribution, even for low-dimensional toy systems. We trace this inconsistency to inaccuracies of the learned score at very small diffusion timesteps, where the model must capture the correct evolution of the data distribution. In this regime, diffusion models fail to satisfy the Fokker--Planck equation, which governs the evolution of the score. We interpret this deviation as the source of the observed inconsistencies and propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker--Planck-derived regularization term to enforce consistency. We demonstrate our approach by sampling and simulating multiple biomolecular systems, including fast-folding proteins, and by introducing a state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports simulation and achieves improved consistency and efficient sampling.

However, current progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while overlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific insight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework designed for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction. MoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture where distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel groups, mimicking specialized brain networks. The experts are first trained to encode fMRI into the frozen CLIP space. A finetuned diffusion model then synthesizes images, guided by expert outputs through a novel dual-stage routing mechanism that dynamically weighs expert contributions across the diffusion process. MoRE-Brain offers three main advancements: First, it introduces a novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture grounded in brain network principles for neuro-decoding. Second, it achieves efficient cross-subject generalization by sharing core expert networks while adapting only subject-specific routers. Third, it provides enhanced mechanistic insight, as the explicit routing reveals precisely how different modeled brain regions shape the semantic and spatial attributes of the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments validate MoRE-Brain’s high reconstruction fidelity, with bottleneck analyses further demonstrating its effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine neural decoding from over-reliance on generative priors. Consequently, MoRE-Brain marks a substantial advance towards more generalizable and interpretable fMRI-based visual decoding.",

At training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information. However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work, we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an \\emph{inference time text confounding} problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework leverages large language models (LLMs) together with a custom doubly robust learner to mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding.

However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants,  2) up to a 50\\% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge the gap between the two fields.

Conditioned on these covariates, the data is modeled with linear dynamics. This allows for transparent interpretation and tractable Bayesian inference. We find that CLDS models can perform well even in severely data-limited regimes (e.g. one trial per condition) due to their Bayesian formulation and ability to share statistical power across nearby task conditions.

Existing studies have also indicated that the relationships between region of interest (ROI) are not one-to-one when synchronizing fMRI and EEG. Current graph-based multimodal modeling methods overlook those information. Based on this, we propose a hypergraph based fMRI-EEG modeling framework for asynchronous fMRI-EEG data named FE-NET.

We characterize conditions under which agents with full information about the causal structure and the principal's classifier align with the principal's goals of incentivizing effort mostly in ``desirable'' features, and identify cases where designing such classifiers (from the principal's side) is still tractable despite general non-convexity. Under incomplete information, we show that uncertainty leads agents to prioritize features with high expected impact and low variance, which may often be misaligned with the principal's goals.

Reporting multiple effect measures—both absolute (e.g., risk difference, number needed to treat) and relative (e.g., risk ratio, odds ratio)—is essential to ensure clinical relevance, policy utility, and interpretability across contexts.\nTo address this gap, we propose a unified framework for transporting a broad class of first-moment population causal effect measures under covariate shift. We provide identification results under two conditional exchangeability assumptions, derive both classical and semiparametric estimators, and evaluate their performance through theoretical analysis, simulations, and real-world applications. Our analysis shows the specificity of different causal measures and thus the interest of studying them all: for instance, two common approaches (one-step, estimating equation) lead to similar estimators for the risk difference but to two distinct estimators for the odds ratio.",

To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes will be released.",

    "abstract": "Molecular representation learning has emerged as a promising approach for modeling molecules with deep learning in chemistry and beyond. While 3D geometric models effectively capture molecular structure, they typically process single static conformers, overlooking the inherent flexibility and dynamics of molecules. In reality, many molecular properties depend on distributions of thermodynamically accessible conformations rather than single structures. Recent works show that learning from conformer ensembles can improve molecular representations, but existing approaches either produce unphysical structures through averaging or require restrictive molecular alignment. In this paper, we propose SymmetryPreserving Conformer Ensemble networks (SPiCE), which introduces two key innovations: (1) geometric mixture-of-experts for selective processing of scalar and vector features, and (2) hierarchical ensemble encoding that combines ensemblelevel representation with cross-conformer integration. Crucially, SPiCE ensures physically meaningful representations by maintaining joint equivariance to geometric transformations of individual conformers and conformer permutations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPiCE consistently outperforms existing conformer ensemble methods and state-of-the-art structural aggregation models across quantum mechanical and biological property prediction tasks.",

However, most existing methods, particularly autoregressive (AR) frameworks, primarily rely on straightforward temporal sequencing of multi-channel EEG data, which fails to capture the rich physiological characteristics inherent to EEG signals. Moreover, their time-centered modeling approach also limits the effective representation of the dynamic spatial topology of brain activity. To address these challenges and fully exploit the potential of large-scale EEG models, we propose a novel Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling (THD-BAR) for EEG generic representations. The core innovation of THD-BAR lies in the introduction of the Brain Topology Hierarchy (BTH), which establishes a multi-scale spatial order for EEG channels. This hierarchical structure enables a redefinition of autoregressive learning as a \"next-scale-time prediction\" problem, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Based on BTH, we design a Topology-Hierarchical Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (THVQ-VAE) for multi-scale tokenization and develop an enhanced Brain Autoregressive (BAR) module with specialized masking strategies for prediction. Through extensive large-scale pre-training on 17 datasets, followed by rigorous validation on 10 downstream datasets spanning 5 distinct tasks, THD-BAR consistently outperforms existing methods. These results highlight the superior generalization and modeling capabilities of our proposed approach.",

In spite of the promise, they face the challenge of designing quantum circuits that both solve the target problem and comply with device limitations. Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates the design process of quantum circuits, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a promising approach. Yet, RL-based QAS methods encounter significant scalability issues, as computational and training costs grow rapidly with the number of qubits, circuit depth, and hardware noise. To address these challenges, we introduce $\\textit{TensorRL-QAS}$, {an improved} framework that combines tensor network methods with RL for QAS. By warm-starting the QAS with a matrix product state approximation of the target solution, TensorRL-QAS effectively narrows the search space to physically meaningful circuits and accelerates the convergence to the desired solution. Tested on several quantum chemistry problems of up to 12-qubit, TensorRL-QAS achieves up to a 10-fold reduction in CNOT count and circuit depth compared to baseline methods, while maintaining or surpassing chemical accuracy. It reduces classical optimizer function evaluation by up to 100-fold, accelerates training episodes by up to 98\\%, and can achieve 50\\% success probability for 10-qubit systems, far exceeding the $<$1\\% rates of baseline. Robustness and versatility are demonstrated both in the noiseless and noisy scenarios, where we report a simulation of an 8-qubit system. Furthermore, TensorRL-QAS demonstrates effectiveness on systems on 20-qubit quantum systems, positioning it as a state-of-the-art quantum circuit discovery framework for near-term hardware and beyond.",

Here, we introduce a numerical framework leveraging Koopman Theory combined with Deep Neural Networks to effectively characterize separatrices. Specifically, we approximate Koopman Eigenfunctions (KEFs) associated with real positive eigenvalues, which vanish precisely at the separatrices. Utilizing these scalar KEFs, optimization methods efficiently locate separatrices even in complex systems. We demonstrate our approach on synthetic benchmarks, ecological network models, and high-dimensional recurrent neural networks trained on either neuroscience-inspired tasks or fit to real neural data. Moreover, we illustrate the practical utility of our method by designing optimal perturbations that can shift systems across separatrices, enabling predictions relevant to optogenetic stimulation experiments in neuroscience.",

A-GPS learns a generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces _preference direction vectors_ that encode user-specified preferences in objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach\nthat achieves high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume computation, and flexibly captures user preferences.

    "abstract": "Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test samples and the training data distribution to identify differences. State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard the training data after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This is because shipping the training data with the deployed model is usually impossible due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound, histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of their training data for OOD detection services.

    "abstract": "In various scientific and engineering domains, where data acquisition is costly—such as in medical imaging, environmental monitoring, or remote sensing—strategic sampling from unobserved regions, guided by prior observations, is essential to maximize target discovery within a limited sampling budget. In this work, we introduce Diffusion-guided Active Target Discovery (DiffATD), a novel method that leverages diffusion dynamics for active target discovery. DiffATD maintains a belief distribution over each unobserved state in the environment, using this distribution to dynamically balance exploration-exploitation. Exploration reduces uncertainty by sampling regions with the highest expected entropy, while exploitation targets areas with the highest likelihood of discovering the target, indicated by the belief distribution and an incrementally trained reward model designed to learn the characteristics of the target. DiffATD enables efficient target discovery in a partially observable environment within a fixed sampling budget, all without relying on any prior supervised training. Furthermore,  DiffATD offers interpretability, unlike existing black-box policies that require extensive supervised training. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across diverse domains, including medical imaging, species discovery and remote sensing, we show that DiffATD performs significantly better than baselines and competitively with supervised methods that operate under full environmental observability.",

    "abstract": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a standard weakly supervised approach for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, where performance hinges on both feature representation and MIL pooling strategies. Recent research has predominantly focused on Transformer-based architectures adapted for WSIs. However, we argue that this trend faces a fundamental limitation: data scarcity. In typical settings, Transformer models yield only marginal gains without access to large-scale datasets—resources that are virtually inaccessible to all but a few well-funded research labs. Motivated by this, we revisit simple, non-attention MIL with unsupervised slide features and analyze temperature-$\\beta$-controlled log-sum-exp (LSE) pooling. For slides partitioned into $N$ patches, we theoretically show that LSE has a smooth transition at a critical $\\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}=\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$ threshold, interpolating between mean-like aggregation (stable, better generalization but less sensitive) and max-like aggregation (more sensitive but looser generalization bounds). Grounded in this analysis, we introduce Maxsoft—a novel MIL pooling function that enables flexible control over this trade-off, allowing adaptation to specific tasks and datasets. To further tackle real-world deployment challenges such as specimen heterogeneity, we propose PerPatch augmentation—a simple yet effective technique that enhances model robustness. Empirically, Maxsoft achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-data regimes across four major benchmarks (CAMELYON16, CAMELYON17, TCGA-Lung, and SICAP-MIL), often matching or surpassing large-scale foundation models. When combined with PerPatch augmentation, this performance is further improved through increased robustness.

To address this, we propose \\textit{random search neural networks} (RSNNs), which operate on random searches, each of which guarantees full node coverage. Theoretically, we demonstrate that in sparse graphs, only $O(\\log |V|)$ searches are needed to achieve full edge coverage, substantially reducing sampling complexity compared to the $O(|V|)$ walks required by RWNNs (assuming walk lengths scale with graph size). Furthermore, when paired with universal sequence models, RSNNs are universal approximators. We lastly show RSNNs are probabilistically invariant to graph isomorphisms, ensuring their expectation is an isomorphism-invariant graph function. Empirically, RSNNs consistently outperform RWNNs on molecular and protein benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior performance with up to 16$\\times$ fewer sampled sequences. Our work bridges theoretical and practical advances in random walk based approaches, offering an efficient and expressive framework for learning on sparse graphs.",

Recently, explainability methods for deep time series models have seen significant progress by adopting saliency methods that perturb masked segments of time series to uncover their importance towards the prediction of black-box models. Thus far, such methods have been largely restricted to regular time series. Irregular time series, however, sampled at irregular time intervals and potentially with missing values, are the dominant form of time series in various critical domains (e.g., hospital records). In this paper, we conduct the first evaluation of saliency methods for the interpretation of irregular time series models. We first translate techniques for regular time series into the continuous time realm of irregular time series and show under which circumstances such techniques are still applicable. However, existing perturbation techniques neglect the timing and structure of observed data, e.g., informative missingness when data is not missing at random. Thus, we propose Contimask, a simple framework to also apply non-differentiable perturbations, such as simulating that parts of the data had not been observed using NeuroEvolution. Doing so, we successfully detect how structural differences in the data can bias irregular time series models on a real-world sepsis prediction task where 90% of the data is missing.

    "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities for AI-driven chemical problem solving. However, existing chemical LLMs are typically tailored to specific task formats or narrow domains, limiting their capacity to integrate knowledge and generalize across tasks. Model merging offers a promising route for efficiently combining specialized LLMs into a unified model without access to original training data, which is urgently needed in the chemical domain where in-house data and privacy preservation are critical. However, effective model merging in the chemical domain poses unique challenges: (1) significant disparities among chemical LLMs due to task-specific specialization, and (2) a highly imbalanced distribution of chemical LLMs in targeted downstream tasks, where some are over-benchmarked while others remain underexplored. These challenges intensify model inconsistencies such as parameter interference and accumulated fine-tuning noise, which collectively hinder effective model merging. To this end, we propose Curriculum Model Merging (CMM), a curriculum-based framework that progressively merges expert chemical LLMs in a moderate and continual manner. CMM aims to harmonize their inconsistencies while meantime preserve their domain-specific expertise. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that CMM effectively consolidates task-specific expertise and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 29.03\\% in terms of overall average performance. Moreover, CMM facilitates chemical knowledge generalization across prediction and generative tasks without sacrificing robustness, exhibiting promising merging performance under both expert-abundant and expert-sparse scenarios.",

Due to the vast combinatorial search space, identifying viable synthetic routes remains a significant challenge--even for expert chemists. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly equipped with reinforcement learning, have demonstrated strong human-like reasoning and planning abilities, especially in mathematics and code problem solving. This raises a natural question: Can the reasoning capabilities of LLMs be harnessed to develop an AI chemist capable of learning effective policies for multi-step retrosynthesis? In this study, we introduce Retro-R1, a novel LLM-based retrosynthesis agent trained via reinforcement learning to design molecular synthesis pathways. Unlike prior approaches, which typically rely on single-turn, question-answering formats, Retro-R1 interacts dynamically with plug-in single-step retrosynthesis tools and learns from environmental feedback. Experimental results show that Retro-R1 achieves a 55.79\\% pass@1 success rate, surpassing the previous state of the art by 8.95\\%. Notably, Retro-R1 demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain test cases, where existing methods tend to fail despite their high in-domain performance.

However, current editing approaches face significant limitations due to parameter drift, which stems from inconsistencies between newly edited knowledge and the model's existing knowledge. In sequential editing scenarios, cumulative drifts progressively lead to model collapse characterized by general capability degradation and balance between acquiring new knowledge and catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. Drawing inspiration from the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit for continual memorizing and forgetting, we propose a Hippocampal-like Sequential Editing (HSE) framework that designs the unlearning of obsolete knowledge, domain-specific knowledge update separation and replay for edited knowledge. Specifically, the HSE framework designs three core mechanisms: (1) Machine unlearning selectively erases outdated knowledge to facilitate integration of new information, (2) Fisher Information Matrix-guided parameter updates prevents cross-domain knowledge interference, and (3) Parameter replay consolidates long-term editing memory through lightweight and global replay of editing data in a parametric form. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that HSE achieves smaller generalization error bounds, more stable convergence and higher computational efficiency. Experimental results validate its effective balance between acquiring new knowledge and mitigating catastrophic forgetting, maintaining or even slightly enhancing general capabilities. In practical applications, experiments confirm its effectiveness in multi-domain hallucination mitigation, healthcare knowledge injecting, and societal bias reduction.",

In medical imaging, such prediction can support radiologists in interpreting complex data, such as chest X-rays. Many existing methods rely on generic vision--language models and saliency-based features, which can limit their ability to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and integrate domain knowledge effectively. We present \\textbf{LogitGaze-Med}, a state-of-the-art multimodal transformer framework that unifies (1) domain-specific visual encoders (e.g., CheXNet), (2) textual embeddings of diagnostic labels, and (3) semantic priors extracted via the logit-lens from an instruction-tuned medical vision--language model (LLaVA-Med). By directly predicting continuous fixation coordinates and dwell durations, our model generates clinically meaningful scanpaths. Experiments on the GazeSearch dataset and synthetic scanpaths generated from MIMIC-CXR and validated by experts demonstrate that LogitGaze-Med improves scanpath similarity metrics by 20--30\\% over competitive baselines and yields over 5\\% gains in downstream pathology classification when incorporating predicted fixations as additional training data.",

Traditional methods that rely solely on rigid transformations often fail to capture the adaptive interactions between targets and drugs, particularly during substantial conformational changes in targets upon ligand binding, which becomes especially critical when learning target-drug interactions in drug design. Accurately modeling these changes is crucial for understanding target-drug interactions and improving drug efficacy. To address these challenges, we introduce DynaPhArM, an SE(3)-Equivariant Transformer model specifically designed to capture adaptive alterations occurring within target-drug interactions. DynaPhArM utilizes the cooperative scalar-vector representation, drug-specific embeddings, and a diffusion process to effectively model the evolving dynamics of interactions between targets and drugs. Furthermore, we integrate physical information and energetic principles that maintain essential geometric constraints, such as bond lengths, bond angles, van der Waals forces (vdW), within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework to enhance accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that DynaPhArM achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 2.01 Å and a sc-RMSD of 0.29 Å while exhibiting higher success rates compared to existing methodologies. Additionally, DynaPhArM shows promise in enhancing drug specificity, thereby simulating how targets adapt to various drugs through precise modeling of atomic-level interactions and conformational flexibility.",

Many of these approaches formulate the sampling task as a stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem using a canonical uninformative reference process, which limits their ability to efficiently guide trajectories toward the target distribution. In this work, we propose the **Non-Equilibrium Annealed Adjoint Sampler (NAAS)**, a novel SOC-based diffusion framework that employs annealed reference dynamics as a non-stationary base SDE. This annealing structure provides a natural progression toward the target distribution and generates informative reference trajectories, thereby enhancing the stability and efficiency of learning the control. Owing to our SOC formulation, our framework can incorporate a variety of SOC solvers, thereby offering high flexibility in algorithmic design. As one instantiation, we employ a lean adjoint system inspired by adjoint matching, enabling efficient and scalable training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NAAS across a range of tasks, including sampling from classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distributions.",

Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic, bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and scalability.\nTo transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features, enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder gradient blocking for stable, focused learning.\nEvaluations on a demanding 9-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing task show our model substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex sequence generation.\nOur code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/denovo",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and are increasingly applied to other sequential data types, including genetic sequences. However, adapting LLMs to genetics presents significant challenges. Capturing complex genomic interactions requires modeling long-range global dependencies within DNA sequences, where interactions often span over 10,000 base pairs, even within a single gene. This poses substantial computational demands under conventional model architectures and training paradigms. Additionally, traditional LLM training approaches are suboptimal for DNA sequences: autoregressive training, while efficient for training, only supports unidirectional sequence understanding. However, DNA is inherently bidirectional. For instance, bidirectional promoters regulate gene expression in both directions and govern approximately 11% of human gene expression. Masked language models (MLMs) enable bidirectional understanding. However, they are inefficient since only masked tokens contribute to loss calculations at each training step. To address these limitations, we introduce JanusDNA, the first bidirectional DNA foundation model built upon a novel pretraining paradigm, integrating the optimization efficiency of autoregressive modeling with the bidirectional comprehension capability of masked modeling. JanusDNA's architecture leverages a Mamba-Attention Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, combining the global, high-resolution context awareness of attention mechanisms with the efficient sequential representation learning capabilities of Mamba. The MoE layers further enhance the model's capacity through sparse parameter scaling, while maintaining manageable computational costs. Notably, JanusDNA can process up to 1 million base pairs at single-nucleotide resolution on a single 80GB GPU using its hybrid architecture. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that JanusDNA achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three genomic representation benchmarks. Remarkably, JanusDNA surpasses models with 250x more activated parameters, underscoring its efficiency and effectiveness. Code available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/JanusDNA/.",

However, this capability also poses significant dual-use risks, including the potential creation of harmful biological agents. To address these biosecurity challenges, we introduce two innovative watermarking techniques: DNAMark and CentralMark. DNAMark employs synonymous codon substitutions to embed robust watermarks in DNA sequences while preserving the function of encoded proteins. CentralMark advances this by creating inheritable watermarks that transfer from DNA to translated proteins, leveraging protein embeddings to ensure detection across the central dogma. Both methods utilize state-of-the-art embeddings to generate watermark logits, enhancing resilience against natural mutations, synthesis errors, and adversarial attacks. Evaluated on a therapeutic DNA benchmark, DNAMark and CentralMark achieve F1 detection scores above 0.85 under diverse conditions, while maintaining over 60\\% sequence similarity to ground truth and degeneracy scores below 15\\%. A case study on a CRISPR-Cas9 system underscores CentralMark’s utility in real-world synthetic biology.

    "abstract": "Characterizing interactions between brain areas is a fundamental goal of systems neuroscience. While such analyses are possible when areas are recorded simultaneously, it is rare to observe all combinations of areas of interest within a single animal or recording session. How can we leverage multi-animal datasets to better understand multi-area interactions? Building on recent progress in large-scale, multi-animal models, we introduce NeuroPaint, a masked autoencoding approach for inferring the dynamics of unobserved brain areas. By training across animals with overlapping subsets of recorded areas, NeuroPaint learns to reconstruct activity in missing areas based on shared structure across individuals. We train and evaluate our approach on both synthetic data and two multi-animal, multi-area Neuropixels datasets. Our results demonstrate that models trained across animals with partial observations can successfully in-paint the dynamics of unrecorded areas, enabling multi-area analyses that transcend the limitations of any single experiment.",

Three-dimensional (3D) registration is a critical step in ssEM, tasked with rectifying axial misalignments and nonlinear distortions introduced during serial sectioning. The core scientific challenge lies in achieving distortion mitigation without erasing the natural morphological deformations of biological tissues, thereby enabling faithful reconstruction of 3D ultrastructural organization. In this study, we present a paradigm-shifting optimization framework that rethinks 3D registration through the lens of manifold trajectory optimization. We propose the first continuous trajectory dynamics formulation for 3D registration and introduce a novel optimization strategy. Specifically, we introduce a dual optimization objective that inherently balances global trajectory smoothness with local structural preservation, while developing a solver that combines Gauss-Seidel iteration with Neural ODEs to systematically integrate biophysical priors with data-driven deformation compensation. A key strength of our method is its fully unsupervised training, which avoids reliance on ground truth and suits ssEM scenarios where annotations are difficult to obtain. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets spanning diverse tissue types demonstrate our method's superior performance in structural restoration accuracy and cross-tissue robustness.",

Applied to both synthetic and real spike-time data from rodent hippocampus, our methods demonstrate superior accuracy and scalability compared to traditional binned GLMs, enabling functional connectivity inference in large-scale neural recordings that are temporally precise on the order of synaptic dynamical timescales.

Gradual generation in theory comes with many conceptual benefits; for example, inductive biases can be incorporated into the noising Markov process. In practice, however, the consistently best performing discrete diffusion model is masking diffusion, which does not denoise gradually. Here we explain the superior performance of masking diffusion by noting that it makes use of a fundamental difference between continuous and discrete Markov processes: discrete Markov processes evolve by discontinuous jumps at a fixed rate and, unlike other discrete diffusion models, masking diffusion builds in the known distribution of jump times and only learns where to jump to. We show that we can similarly bake in the known distribution of jump times into any discrete diffusion model. The resulting models -- schedule-conditioned diffusion (SCUD) -- generalize classical discrete diffusion and masking diffusion. By applying SCUD to models with noising processes that incorporate inductive biases on images, text, and protein data, we build diffusion models that outperform masking.",

But with this influence comes the risk of amplifying misinformation and deepening social divides—especially on consequential topics where factual accuracy directly impacts well-being. Scalable Oversight aims to ensure AI systems remain truthful even when their capabilities exceed those of their evaluators. Yet when humans serve as evaluators, their own beliefs and biases can impair judgment. We study whether AI debate can guide biased judges toward the truth by having two AI systems debate opposing sides of controversial factuality claims on COVID-19 and climate change where people hold strong prior beliefs. We conduct two studies. Study I recruits human judges with either mainstream or skeptical beliefs who evaluate claims through two protocols: debate (interaction with two AI advisors arguing opposing sides) or consultancy (interaction with a single AI advisor). Study II uses AI judges with and without human-like personas to evaluate the same protocols. In Study I, debate consistently improves human judgment accuracy and confidence calibration, outperforming consultancy by 4-10\\% across COVID-19 and climate change claims. The improvement is most significant for judges with mainstream beliefs (up to +15.2\\% accuracy on COVID-19 claims), though debate also helps skeptical judges who initially misjudge claims move toward accurate views (+4.7\\% accuracy). In Study II, AI judges with human-like personas achieve even higher accuracy (78.5\\%) than human judges (70.1\\%) and default AI judges without personas (69.8\\%), suggesting their potential for supervising frontier AI models. These findings highlight AI debate as a promising path toward scalable, bias-resilient oversight in contested domains.",

However, its direct use in training deep models that are sensitive to fine-grained atomic geometry—such as inverse folding—exposes a critical limitation. Comparative analysis of structural feature distributions reveals that AFDB structures exhibit distinct statistical regularities, reflecting a systematic geometric bias that deviates from the conformational diversity found in experimentally determined structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). While AFDB structures are cleaner and more idealized, PDB structures capture the intrinsic variability and physical realism essential for generalization in downstream tasks. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a Debiasing Structure AutoEncoder (DeSAE) that learns to reconstruct native-like conformations from intentionally corrupted backbone geometries. By training the model to recover plausible structural states, DeSAE implicitly captures a more robust and natural structural manifold. At inference, applying DeSAE to AFDB structures produces debiased structures that significantly improve inverse folding performance across multiple benchmarks. This work highlights the critical impact of subtle systematic biases in predicted structures and presents a principled framework for debiasing, significantly boosting the performance of structure-based learning tasks like inverse folding.",

However, existing GNN-based methods often face challenges in learning multiscale representations and modeling long-range dependencies efficiently. In this work, we propose an efficient multiscale graph-based learning framework tailored to proteins. Our proposed framework contains two crucial components: (1) It constructs a hierarchical graph representation comprising a collection of fine-grained subgraphs, each corresponding to a secondary structure motif (e.g., $\\alpha$-helices, $\\beta$-strands, loops), and a single coarse-grained graph that connects these motifs based on their spatial arrangement and relative orientation. (2) It employs two GNNs for feature learning: the first operates within individual secondary motifs to capture local interactions, and the second models higher-level structural relationships across motifs. Our modular framework allows a flexible choice of GNN in each stage. Theoretically, we show that our hierarchical framework preserves the desired maximal expressiveness, ensuring no loss of critical structural information. Empirically, we demonstrate that integrating baseline GNNs into our multiscale framework remarkably improves prediction accuracy and reduces computational cost across various benchmarks.",

However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent–child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch–text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data.

This gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process, shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences (e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration. ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices. Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5\\% over the strongest cutting-edge models.  Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling human-centric decisions.

RoPE, a recent SBI approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting, requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits scalability and generalization.  We propose a fully inductive and amortized SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at test time. \nAcross a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or exceeds the performance of RoPE, while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging, misspecified environments.",

To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a novel fully SAM-based semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework and develop the corresponding knowledge distillation-based learning strategy. Specifically, we first employ an efficient SAM variant as the backbone network of the semi‑supervised framework and update the default prompt embedding of SAM to unleash its full potential. Then, we utilize an original SAM, which is rich in prior knowledge, as the teacher to optimize our efficient student SAM backbone through hierarchical knowledge distillation and a dynamic loss weighting strategy. Extensive experiments on various medical datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation approaches.

We conceptualise this as a multi-level data generation process and investigate the scaling behaviour of model performance with respect to the overall sample size and the participant diversity through large-scale empirical studies. We then use the same framework to investigate the effectiveness of different ML strategies designed to address limited data problems: data augmentations and self-supervised learning. Our findings show that model performance scaling can be severely constrained by participant distribution shifts and provide actionable guidance for data collection and ML research.

However, two key challenges remain unresolved: 1) how to effectively model the intra-modal long-range dependencies and inter-modal correlations in multimodal physiological emotion signals, and 2) how to address the performance limitations resulting from missing multimodal data. In this paper, we propose a multimodal bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) network with test-time adaptation (TTA) for emotion recognition named BiM-TTA. Specifically, BiM-TTA consists of a multimodal BiMamba network and a multimodal TTA. The former includes intra-modal and inter-modal BiMamba modules, which model long-range dependencies along the time dimension and capture cross-modal correlations along the channel dimension, respectively. The latter (TTA) mitigates the amplified distribution shifts caused by missing multimodal data through two-level entropy-based sample filtering and mutual information sharing across modalities. By addressing these challenges, BiM-TTA achieves state-of-the-art results on two multimodal emotion datasets.",

However, achieving high-quality and stable translations typically requires paired data, which poses a challenge in scenarios with limited annotations in the target domain. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method termed Stain-Guided Cycle Diffusion (SGCD), employing a dual diffusion model with bidirectional generative constraints to synthesize highly realistic data for downstream task fine-tuning. The bidirectional generative constraints ensure that the translated images retain the features critical to the downstream model in properly controlling the generation process. Additionally, a stain-guided consistency loss is introduced to enhance the denoising capability of the dual diffusion model, thereby improving the quality of images translated between different domains using latents from one domain and a diffusion model trained on another. Experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that SGCD can effectively enhance the performance of downstream task models on the target domain.",

A key challenge lies in efficiently narrowing down a large space of possible outcomes by posing questions that minimize uncertainty. To address this, we introduce a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate information-seeking questions, with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to strategically select questions that maximize information gain, as a part of inference-time planning. Our primary contribution includes a hierarchical feedback mechanism that exploits past interaction patterns to guide future strategy. Specifically, each new problem is mapped to a cluster based on semantic similarity, and our UCT (Upper Confidence bound for Trees) formulation employs a cluster-specific bonus reward to prioritize successful question trajectories that have proven effective for similar problems in the past. Extensive empirical evaluation across medical diagnosis and technical troubleshooting domains shows that our method achieves an average of 12\\% improvement in success rates and about 10x reduction in the number of LLM calls made for planning per conversation, compared to the state of the art. An additional 8\\% gain in success rate is observed on average when we start with a constrained set of possibilities. Our results underscore the efficacy of feedback-aware MCTS in enhancing information-seeking in goal-oriented dialogues.",

Here, we introduce Semi-Supervised Model Evaluation (SSME), a method that uses both labeled and unlabeled data to evaluate machine learning classifiers. The key idea is to estimate the joint distribution of ground truth labels and classifier scores using a semi-supervised mixture model. The semi-supervised mixture model allows SSME to learn from three sources of information: unlabeled data, multiple classifiers, and probabilistic classifier scores. Once fit, the mixture model enables estimation of any metric that is a function of classifier scores and ground truth labels (e.g., accuracy or AUC). We derive theoretical bounds on the error of these estimates, showing that estimation error decreases with the number of classifiers and the amount of unlabeled data. We present experiments in four domains where obtaining large labeled datasets is often impractical: healthcare, content moderation, molecular property prediction, and text classification. Our results demonstrate that SSME estimates performance more accurately than do competing methods, reducing error by 5.1x relative to using labeled data alone and 2.4x relative to the next best method.",

While recent deep learning methods have achieved impressive performance by recovering native sequences, they often overlook the one-to-many nature of the problem: multiple diverse sequences can fold into the same structure. This motivates the need for a generative model capable of designing diverse sequences while preserving structural consistency. To address this trade-off, we introduce ProtInvTree, the first reward-guided tree-search framework for protein inverse folding. ProtInvTree reformulates sequence generation as a deliberate, step-wise decision-making process, enabling the exploration of multiple design paths and exploitation of promising candidates through self-evaluation, lookahead, and backtracking. We propose a two-stage focus-and-grounding action mechanism that decouples position selection and residue generation. To efficiently evaluate intermediate states, we introduce a jumpy denoising strategy that avoids full rollouts. Built upon pretrained protein language models, ProtInvTree supports flexible test-time scaling by adjusting the search depth and breadth without retraining. Empirically, ProtInvTree outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, generating structurally consistent yet diverse sequences, including those far from the native ground truth.

Meanwhile, the computational burden and heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this, we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint (signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels (sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight the interpretability of GCM. This work offers a novel perspective on FBN structure learning and provides a foundation for interdisciplinary applications in cognitive neuroscience.

    "abstract": "A central challenge in organ transplantation is the extremely low acceptance rate of donor organ offers—typically in the single digits—leading to high discard rates and suboptimal use of available grafts. Current acceptance models embedded in allocation systems are non-causal, trained on observational data, and fail to generalize to policy-relevant counterfactuals. This limits their reliability for both policy evaluation and simulator-based optimization. In this work, we reframe organ offer acceptance as a counterfactual prediction problem and propose a method to learn from routinely recorded—but often overlooked—refusal explanations. These refusal reasons act as direction-only counterfactual signals: for example, a refusal reason such as \"old donor age\" implies acceptance might have occurred had the donor been younger. We formalize this setting and introduce ClexNet, a novel causal  model that learns policy-invariant representations via balanced training and an explanation-guided augmentation loss. On both synthetic and semi-synthetic data, ClexNet outperforms existing acceptance models in predictive performance, generalization, and calibration, offering a robust drop-in improvement for simulators and allocation policy evaluation. Beyond transplantation, our approach provides a general method for incorporating human direction-only explanations as a form of model supervision, improving performance in settings where only observational data is available.",

However, these approaches remain limited in characterizing the brain’s inherently nonlinear response properties. To address this, we propose the Jacobian-based Nonlinearity Evaluation (JNE), an interpretability metric for nonlinear neural encoding models. JNE quantifies nonlinearity by statistically measuring the dispersion of local linear mappings (Jacobians) from model representations to predicted BOLD responses, thereby approximating the nonlinearity of BOLD signals. Centered on proposing JNE as a novel interpretability metric, we validated its effectiveness through controlled simulation experiments on various activation functions and network architectures, and further verified it on real fMRI data, demonstrating a hierarchical progression of nonlinear characteristics from primary to higher-order visual cortices, consistent with established cortical organization. We further extended JNE with Sample-Specificity (JNE-SS), revealing stimulus-selective nonlinear response patterns in functionally specialized brain regions. As the first interpretability metric for quantifying nonlinear responses, JNE provides new insights into brain information processing. Code available at https://github.com/Gaitxh/JNE.",

This visual-to-neural mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. \nOur code is available at https://github.com/MichaelMaiii/SynBrain.",

In such cases, dynamic near-field lighting introduces strong, view-dependent shading that significantly degrades SLAM performance. We introduce Near-Field Lighting Bundle Adjustment Loss (NFL-BA) which explicitly models near-field lighting as a part of Bundle Adjustment loss and enables better performance for scenes captured with dynamic lighting. NFL-BA can be integrated into neural rendering-based SLAM systems with implicit or explicit scene representations. Our evaluations mainly focus on endoscopy procedure where SLAM can enable autonomous navigation, guidance to unsurveyed regions, blindspot detections, and 3D visualizations, which can significantly improve patient outcomes and endoscopy experience for both physicians and patients. Replacing Photometric Bundle Adjustment loss of SLAM systems with NFL-BA leads to significant improvement in camera tracking, 37% for MonoGS and 14% for EndoGSLAM, and leads to state-of-the-art camera tracking and mapping performance on the C3VD colonoscopy dataset. Further evaluation on indoor scenes captured with phone camera with flashlight turned on, also demonstrate significant improvement in SLAM performance due to NFL-BA.",

However, rather than merely generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing methods for achieving this goal often require differentiable proxy models (e.g., classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (e.g., classifier-free guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enhanced document understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However, existing models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world scenarios, particularly under visual degradation (e.g., blur, occlusion, low contrast). In such conditions, the current response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation and ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned visual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently results in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise answer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and problem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR hallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test samples spanning identity cards, invoices, and prescriptions, with simulated real-world degradations and pixel-level annotations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models' capacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and answer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding hallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and thereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based framework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness of visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer to increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model achieves a ~28% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o on KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks, highlighting both effectiveness and robustness. This work advances the development of reliable MLLMs for real-world document analysis by addressing critical challenges in visual-linguistic alignment under degradation.",

    "abstract": "Virtual screening (VS) is a critical component of modern drug discovery, yet most existing methods—whether physics-based or deep learning-based—are developed around *holo* protein structures with known ligand-bound pockets. Consequently, their performance degrades significantly on *apo* or predicted structures such as those from AlphaFold2, which are more representative of real-world early-stage drug discovery, where pocket information is often missing. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-and-aggregation framework to enable accurate virtual screening under structural uncertainty. Our method comprises two core components: (1) a tri-modal contrastive learning module that aligns representations of the ligand, the *holo* pocket, and cavities detected from structures, thereby enhancing robustness to pocket localization error; and (2) a cross-attention based adapter for dynamically aggregating candidate binding sites, enabling the model to learn from activity data even without precise pocket annotations. We evaluated our method on a newly curated benchmark of *apo* structures, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in blind apo setting, improving the early enrichment factor (EF1\\%) from 11.75 to 37.19. Notably, it also maintains strong performance on *holo* structures. These results demonstrate the promise of our approach in advancing first-in-class drug discovery, particularly in scenarios lacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes.

A central challenge for long-term iBCI deployment is the nonstationarity of neural recordings, where the composition and tuning profiles of the recorded populations are unstable across recording sessions. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by explicit alignment techniques; however, they rely on fixed neural identities and require test-time labels or parameter updates, limiting their generalization across sessions and imposing additional computational burden during deployment. In this work, we address the problem of cross-session nonstationarity in long-term iBCI systems and introduce SPINT - a Spatial Permutation-Invariant Neural Transformer framework for behavioral decoding that operates directly on unordered sets of neural units. Central to our approach is a novel context-dependent positional embedding scheme that dynamically infers unit-specific identities, enabling flexible generalization across recording sessions. SPINT supports inference on variable-size populations and allows few-shot, gradient-free adaptation using a small amount of unlabeled data from the test session. We evaluate SPINT on three multi-session datasets from the FALCON Benchmark, covering continuous motor decoding tasks in human and non-human primates. SPINT demonstrates robust cross-session generalization, outperforming existing zero-shot and few-shot unsupervised baselines while eliminating the need for test-time alignment and fine-tuning. Our work contributes an initial step toward a robust and scalable neural decoding framework for long-term iBCI applications.",

In this paper, we exploit conditional probability transitions in discrete state space and introduce MoleBridge, a deep generative model built on the Markov bridge approach for designing postfix notations of molecular synthesis pathways. MoleBridge consists of two iterative optimizations: i) Autoregressive extending of notation tokens from molecular graphs, and ii) generation of discrete reaction postfix notations through Markov bridge, where noisy token blocks are progressively denoised over multi-step iterations. For the challenging second iteration, which demands sensitivity to incorrect generative probability paths within intricate chemical spaces, we employ a thinking and denoising separation approach to denoise. Empirically, we find that MoleBridge is capable of accurately predicting synthesis pathways while exhibiting excellent performance in a variety of application scenarios.",

This paper employs recent advancements in latent hyperbolic geometry to deepen our understanding of node relationships from a graph-theoretical perspective. We analyze BPR’s limitations, particularly its reliance on local connectivity through 2-hop paths, which overlooks global connectivity and the broader topological structure. To address these shortcomings, we purpose a novel loss function, BPR+, designed to encompass even-hop paths and better capture global connectivity and topological nuances. This approach facilitates a more detailed measurement of user-item relationships and improves the granularity of relationship assessments. We validate BPR+ through extensive empirical testing across five real-world datasets and demonstrate its efficacy in refining graph self-supervised learning frameworks. Additionally, we explore the application of BPR+ in drug repositioning, highlighting its potential to support pharmaceutical research and development. Our findings not only illuminate the success factors of previous methodologies but also offer new theoretical insights into this learning paradigm.",

Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG) descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs, EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves 7.32\\%–12.61\\% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to reach the performence of larger models at under 20\\% of the original cost. It also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.",

While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise-rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-rays, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail.

State-of-the-art generative models are trained on computationally derived structures from AlphaFold2 (AF), as experimentally determined structures are relatively scarce. The resulting models are therefore limited by the quality of synthetic datasets.  Since the accuracy of AF predictions degrades with increasing protein length and complexity, de novo generation of long, complex proteins remains challenging. Ambient Protein Diffusion overcomes this problem by treating low-confidence AF structures as corrupted data.  Rather than simply filtering out low-quality AF structures, our method adjusts the diffusion objective for each structure based on its corruption level, allowing the model to learn from both high and low quality structures. Empirically, ambient protein diffusion yields major improvements: on proteins with 700 residues, diversity increases from 45% to 85% from the previous state-of-the-art, and designability improves from 70% to 88%.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and decoding human brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a fundamental problem in neuroscience and artificial intelligence, with applications ranging from cognition and emotion recognition to clinical diagnosis and brain–computer interfaces. While recent EEG foundation models have made progress in generalized brain decoding by leveraging unified architectures and large-scale pretraining, they inherit a scale-agnostic dense modeling paradigm from NLP and vision. This design overlooks an intrinsic property of neural activity—cross-scale spatiotemporal structure. Different EEG task patterns span a broad range of temporal and spatial scales, from brief neural activations to slow-varying rhythms, and from localized cortical activations to large-scale distributed interactions. Ignoring this diversity may lead to suboptimal representations and weakened generalization ability. To address these limitations, we propose CSBrain, a Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Brain foundation model for generalized EEG decoding. CSBrain introduces two key components: (i) Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenization (CST), which aggregates multi-scale features within localized temporal windows and anatomical brain regions into compact scale-aware token representations; and (ii) Structured Sparse Attention (SSA), which models cross-window and cross-region dependencies for diverse decoding tasks, further enriching scale diversities while eliminating the spurious dependencies. CST and SSA are alternately stacked to progressively integrate cross-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. Extensive experiments across 11 representative EEG tasks and 16 datasets demonstrate that CSBrain consistently outperforms both task-specific models and strong foundation baselines. These results establish cross-scale modeling as a key inductive bias for generalized EEG decoding and highlight CSBrain as a robust backbone for future brain–AI research.",

Leveraging these properties, we propose a Gyro Attention (GyroAtt) framework over general gyrovector spaces, applicable to various matrix geometries.

Although the amount of samples under rich environmental variables is unprecedented, existing brain foundation models learn from fMRI derived from a narrow range of cognitive states stimulated by similar environments, causing the limited robustness demonstrated in various applications and datasets acquired with different pipelines and limited sample size. By capitalizing on the variety of cognitive status as subjects performing explicit tasks, we present the mixture of brain experts, namely BrainMoE, pre-training on tasking fMRI with rich behavioral tasks in addition to resting fMRI for a robust brain foundation model. Brain experts are designed to produce embeddings for different behavioral tasks related to cognition. Afterward, these cognition embeddings are mixed by a cognition adapter via cross-attention so that BrainMoE can handle orthogonal embeddings and be robust on those boutique downstream datasets. We have pre-trained two existing self-regressive architectures and one new supervised architecture as brain experts on 68,251 fMRI scans among UKB and HCP, containing 12 different cognitive states. Then, BrainMoE is evaluated on a variety of applications, including sex, age prediction, human behavior recognition, disease early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Schizophrenia, and fMRI-EEG multimodal applications, where promising results in eight datasets from three different pipelines indicate great potential to facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.",

While multimodal learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities. Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 18 downstream tasks, demonstrating the value of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for molecular property prediction.

However, current algorithms to decompose motor units from high-density electromyography (HD-EMG) are time-consuming and inconsistent, limiting their application to controlled scenarios in a research setting. We introduce MUelim, an algorithm for efficient motor unit decomposition that uses approximate joint diagonalization with a subtractive approach to rapidly identify and refine candidate sources. The algorithm incorporates an extend-lag procedure to augment data for enhanced source separability prior to diagonalization. By systematically iterating and eliminating redundant or noisy sources, MUelim achieves high decomposition accuracy while significantly reducing computational complexity, making it well-suited for real-time applications. We validate MUelim by demonstrating its ability to extract motor units in both simulated and physiological HD-EMG grid data. Across six healthy participants performing ramp and maximum voluntary contraction paradigms, MUelim achieves up to a 36$\\times$ speed increase compared to existing state-of-the-art methods while decomposing a similar number of high signal-to-noise sources. Furthermore, we showcase a real-world application of MUelim in a clinical setting in which an individual with spinal cord injury controlled an EMG-driven neuroprosthetic to perform functional tasks. We demonstrate the ability to decode motor intent in real-time using a spiking neural network trained on the decomposed motor unit spike trains to trigger functional electrical stimulation patterns that evoke hand movements during task practice therapy. We show that motor unit-based decoding enables nuanced motor control, highlighting the potential of MUelim to advance assistive neurotechnology and rehabilitation through precise, intention-driven neuroprosthetic systems.",

Deep learning approaches have achieved promising results, but often requires paired measurement and high-quality images, which is typically simulated through a forward model, i.e., retrospective reconstruction. However, training on simulated pairs commonly leads to performance degradation on real prospective data due to the retrospective-to-prospective gap caused by incomplete imaging knowledge in simulation. To address this challenge, this paper introduces imaging Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport (KIDOT), a novel dynamic optimal transport framework with optimality in the sense of preserving consistency with imaging physics in transport, that conceptualizes reconstruction as finding a dynamic transport path. KIDOT learns from unpaired data by modeling reconstruction as a continuous evolution path from measurements to images, guided by an imaging knowledge-informed cost function and transport equation. This dynamic and knowledge-aware approach enhances robustness and better leverages unpaired data while respecting acquisition physics. Theoretically, we demonstrate that KIDOT naturally generalizes dynamic optimal transport, ensuring its mathematical rationale and solution existence. Extensive experiments on MRI and CT reconstruction demonstrate KIDOT's superior performance. Code is available at https://github.com/TaoranZheng717/KIDOT.",

Modern applications demand methods that simultaneously address two critical challenges: capturing nonlinear dependencies between variables and reconstructing inherent hierarchical structures where higher-level entities coordinate lower-level components (e.g., functional pathways organizing gene clusters). Traditional Gaussian graphical models fundamentally fail in these aspects due to their restrictive linear assumptions and flat network representations. We propose NNBLNet, a neural network-based learning framework for bi-level network inference. The core innovation lies in hierarchical selection layers that enforce structural consistency between high-level  coordinator groups and their constituent low-level connections via adaptive sparsity constraints. This architecture is integrated with a compositional neural network architecture that learn cross-level association patterns through constrained nonlinear transformations, explicitly preserving hierarchical dependencies while overcoming the representational limitations of linear methods. Crucially, we establish formal theoretical guarantees for the consistent recovery of both high-level connections and their internal low-level structures under general statistical regimes. Extensive validation demonstrates NNBLNet's effectiveness across synthetic and real-world scenarios, achieving superior F1 scores compared to competitive methods and particularly beneficial for complex systems analysis through its interpretable bi-level structure discovery.",

While prior work has studied strategic responses broadly, disentangling misreporting from genuine adaptation remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose a causally-motivated approach to identify and quantify how much an agent misreports on average by distinguishing deceptive changes in their features from genuine adaptation. Our key insight is that, unlike genuine adaptation, misreported features do not causally affect downstream variables (i.e., causal descendants). We exploit this asymmetry by comparing the causal effect of misreported features on their causal descendants as derived from manipulated datasets against those from unmanipulated datasets. We formally prove identifiability of the misreporting rate and characterize the variance of our estimator. We empirically validate our theoretical results using a semi-synthetic and real Medicare dataset with misreported data, demonstrating that our approach can be employed to identify misreporting in real-world scenarios.",

To reduce the instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion, we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a 27% improvement on the LD50 task.

We present a latent diffusion model that generates realistic heterogeneous histopathology images through a novel dual-conditioning approach combining semantic segmentation maps with tissue-specific visual crops. Unlike existing methods that rely on text prompts or abstract visual embeddings, our approach preserves critical morphological details by directly incorporating raw tissue crops from corresponding semantic regions. For annotated datasets (i.e., Camelyon16, Panda), we extract patches ensuring 20-80% tissue heterogeneity. For unannotated data (i.e., TCGA), we introduce a self-supervised extension that clusters whole-slide images into 100 tissue types using foundation model embeddings, automatically generating pseudo-semantic maps for training. Our method synthesizes high-fidelity images with precise region-wise annotations, achieving superior performance on downstream segmentation tasks. When evaluated on annotated datasets, models trained on our synthetic data show competitive performance to those trained on real data, demonstrating the utility of controlled heterogeneous tissue generation. In quantitative evaluation, prompt‐guided synthesis reduces Fréchet Distance by up to 6× on Camelyon16 (from 430.1 to 72.0) and yields 2–3× lower FD across Panda and TCGA. Downstream DeepLabv3+ models trained solely on synthetic data attain test IoU of 0.71 and 0.95 on Camelyon16 and Panda, within 1–2% of real‐data baselines (0.72 and 0.96). By scaling to 11,765 TCGA whole‐slide images without manual annotations, our framework offers a practical solution for an urgent need for generating diverse, annotated histopathology data, addressing a critical bottleneck in computational pathology.",

To provide fine-grained learning signals, we devise step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with potential-based reward shaping, which explicitly models DDIs and optimizes the contribution of each drug to the overall prescription. Furthermore, FLAME enhances patient modeling by integrating structured clinical knowledge and collaborative information into the representation space of LLMs. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FLAME achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior accuracy, controllable safety–accuracy trade-offs, and strong generalization across diverse clinical scenarios.

Our method leverages surrogate models with predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions, facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines for molecular quality and property optimization.

    "abstract": "Algorithm unrolling methods have proven powerful for solving the regularized least squares problem in computational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These approaches unfold an iterative algorithm with a fixed number of iterations, typically alternating between a neural network-based proximal operator for regularization, a data fidelity operation and auxiliary updates with learnable parameters. While the connection to optimization methods dictate that the proximal operator network should be shared across unrolls, this can introduce artifacts or blurring. Heuristically, practitioners have shown that using distinct networks may be beneficial, but this significantly increases the number of learnable parameters, making it challenging to prevent overfitting. To address these shortcomings, by taking inspirations from proximal operators with varying thresholds in approximate message passing (AMP) and the success of time-embedding in diffusion models, we propose a time-embedded algorithm unrolling scheme for inverse problems. Specifically, we introduce a novel perspective on the iteration-dependent proximal operation in vector AMP (VAMP) and the subsequent Onsager correction in the context of algorithm unrolling, framing them as a time-embedded neural network. Similarly, the scalar weights in the data fidelity operation and its associated Onsager correction are cast as time-dependent learnable parameters. Our extensive experiments on the fastMRI dataset, spanning various acceleration rates and datasets, demonstrate that our method effectively reduces aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise amplification, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we show that our time-embedding strategy extends to existing algorithm unrolling approaches, enhancing reconstruction quality without increasing the computational complexity significantly.

Yet, uncertainty elaborated in findings and the reasoning process for reaching clinical impressions are seldom explicitly modeled, reducing the clinical accuracy and trustworthiness of the generated reports. We present CURV, a novel framework that alleviates the limitations through integrated awareness of uncertainty and explicit reasoning capabilities. Our approach consists of three key components: (1) an uncertainty modeling mechanism that teaches the model to recognize and express appropriate levels of diagnostic confidence, (2) a structured reasoning framework that generates intermediate explanatory steps connecting visual findings to clinical impressions, and (3) a reasoning coherence reward that ensures logical consistency among findings, reasoning, and impressions. We implement CURV through a three-stage training pipeline that combines uncertainty-aware fine-tuning, reasoning initialization, and reinforcement learning. In particular, we adopt a comprehensive reward function addresses multiple aspects of report quality, incorporating medical term matching, uncertainty expression evaluation, and semantic coherence evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that CURV generates clinically relevant reports with appropriate uncertainty expressions and transparent reasoning traces, significantly outperforming previous methods. CURV represents a substantial advancement toward interpretable and trustworthy AI-generated radiology reports, with broader implications for the deployment of vision-language models in high-stakes clinical environments where uncertainty awareness and reasoning transparency are essential.",

    "abstract": "In typical graph neural networks (GNNs), feature representation learning naturally evolves through iteratively updating node features and exchanging information based on graph topology. In this context, we conceptualize that the learning process in GNNs is a mean-field game (MFG), where each graph node is an agent, interacting with its topologically connected neighbors.  However, current GNNs often employ the identical MFG strategy across different graph datasets, regardless of whether the graph exhibits homophilic or heterophilic characteristics. To address this challenge, we propose to formulate the learning mechanism into a variational framework of the MFG inverse problem, introducing an in-context selective message passing paradigm for each agent, which promotes the best overall outcome for the graph. Specifically, we seek for the application-adaptive transportation function (controlling information exchange throughout the graph) and reaction function (controlling feature representation learning on each agent), *on the fly*, which allows us to uncover the most suitable selective mechanism of message passing by solving an MFG variational problem through the lens of Hamiltonian flows. Taken together, our variational framework unifies existing GNN models into various mean-field games with distinct equilibrium states, each characterized by the learned in-context message passing operators. Furthermore, we present an agnostic end-to-end deep model, coined *Game-of-GNN*, to jointly identify the message passing mechanism and fine-tune the GNN hyper-parameters on top of the elucidated message passing operators. *Game-of-GNN* has achieved SOTA performance on diverse graph data, including popular benchmark datasets and human connectomes. More importantly, the mathematical insight of MFG framework provides a new window to understand the foundational principles of graph learning as an interactive dynamical system, which allows us to reshape the idea of designing next-generation GNN models.",

Current reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have only been applied to time-to-event data, with the objective of maximizing expected survival time. However, alternating recurrent event data has a different structure, which motivates us to model the probability and frequency of event occurrences rather than a single terminal outcome. \nIn this paper, we introduce an RL framework specifically designed for alternating recurrent event data. Our goal is to maximize the probability that the duration between consecutive events exceeds a clinically meaningful threshold. To achieve this, we identify a lower bound of this probability, which transforms the problem into maximizing a cumulative sum of log probabilities, thus enabling direct application of standard RL algorithms. We establish the theoretical properties of the resulting optimal policy and demonstrate through numerical experiments that our proposed algorithm yields a larger probability of that the time between events exceeds a critical threshold compared with existing state-of-the-art algorithms.",

In this work, we systematically quantify and compare the linear and non-linear dimensionality of human brain activity (fMRI) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) during natural image viewing. In the human ventral visual stream, both dimensionality measures increase along the visual hierarchy, supporting the emergence of semantic and abstract representations. For linear dimensionality, most ANNs show a similar increase, but only for pooled features, emphasizing the importance of appropriate feature readouts in brain–model comparisons. In contrast, nonlinear dimensionality shows a collapse in the later layers of ANNs, pointing at a mismatch in representational geometry between the human and artificial visual systems. This mismatch may have functional consequences: while high-dimensional brain representations support flexible generalization to abstract features, ANNs appear to lose this capacity in later layers, where their representations become overly compressed. Overall, our findings propose dimensionality alignment as a benchmark for building more flexible and biologically grounded vision models.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a Schrödinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process---in stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes---which is constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data. We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems.

This paradigm allows DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating multimodal feature fusion.\nExtensive experiments on several multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.\nAblation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.\nCode is anonymously available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/DPMM.git",

    "abstract": "Part of the success of diffusion models stems from their ability to perform iterative refinement, i.e., repeatedly correcting outputs during generation. However, modern masked discrete diffusion lacks this capability: when a token is generated, it cannot be updated again, even when it introduces an error. Here, we address this limitation by introducing the remasking diffusion model (ReMDM) sampler, a method that can be applied to pretrained masked diffusion models in a principled way and that is derived from a discrete diffusion model with a custom remasking backward process. Most interestingly, ReMDM endows discrete diffusion with a form of inference-time compute scaling. By increasing the number of sampling steps, ReMDM generates natural language outputs that approach the quality of autoregressive models, whereas when the computation budget is limited, ReMDM better maintains quality. ReMDM also improves sample quality of masked diffusion models for discretized images, and in scientific domains such as molecule design, ReMDM facilitates diffusion guidance and pushes the Pareto frontier of controllability relative to classical masking and uniform noise diffusion. When applied to large pretrained diffusion language models, ReMDM boosts the model’s performance on downstream tasks requiring factual knowledge grasp and reasoning ability.",

Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1,  a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

Current generative models excel in protein design but face limitations in binding data, substrate-specific control, and flexibility for de novo enzyme backbone generation. To address this, we introduce **EnzyBind**, a dataset with 11,100 experimentally validated enzyme-substrate pairs specifically curated from PDBbind. Building on this, we propose **EnzyControl**, a method that enables functional and substrate-specific control in enzyme backbone generation. Our approach generates enzyme backbones conditioned on MSA-annotated catalytic sites and their corresponding substrates, which are automatically extracted from curated enzyme-substrate data. At the core of EnzyControl is **EnzyAdapter**, a lightweight, modular component integrated into a pretrained motif-scaffolding model, allowing it to become substrate-aware. A two-stage training paradigm further refines the model's ability to generate accurate and functional enzyme structures. Experiments show that our EnzyControl achieves the best performance across structural and functional metrics on EnzyBind and EnzyBench benchmarks, with particularly notable improvements of 13% in designability and 13% in catalytic efficiency compared to the baseline models.

To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieving reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 8% and 6% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively.

    "abstract": "Medical imaging super-resolution is critical for improving diagnostic utility and reducing costs, particularly for low-cost modalities such as portable Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). We propose OCTDiff, a bridged diffusion model designed to enhance image resolution and quality from portable OCT devices. Our image-to-image diffusion framework addresses key challenges in the conditional generation process of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). We introduce Adaptive Noise Aggregation (ANA), a novel module to improve denoising dynamics within the reverse diffusion process. Additionally, we integrate Multi-Scale Cross-Attention (MSCA) into the U-Net backbone to capture local dependencies across spatial resolutions. To address overfitting on small clinical datasets and to preserve fine structural details essential for retinal diagnostics, we design a customized loss function guided by clinical quality scores. OCTDiff outperforms convolutional baselines and standard DDPMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on clinical portable OCT datasets. Our model and its downstream applications have the potential to generalize to other medical imaging modalities and revolutionize the current workflow of ophthalmic diagnostics.

    "abstract": "Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI) classification by aligning visual features with textual representations, thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization. Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities (e.g., nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning (MAPLE), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations within and across scales.  The refined representations are then aggregated into a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot pathology diagnosis tasks.",

    "abstract": "Data integration approaches are increasingly used to enhance the efficiency and generalizability of studies. However, a key limitation of these methods is the assumption that outcome measures are identical across datasets -- an assumption that often does not hold in practice. Consider the following opioid use disorder (OUD) studies: the XBOT trial and the POAT study, both evaluating the effect of medications for OUD on withdrawal symptom severity (not the primary outcome of either trial). While XBOT measures withdrawal severity using the subjective opiate withdrawal scale, POAT uses the clinical opiate withdrawal scale. We analyze this realistic yet challenging setting where outcome measures differ across studies and where neither study records both types of outcomes. Our paper studies whether and when integrating studies with disparate outcome measures leads to efficiency gains. We introduce three sets of assumptions -- with varying degrees of strength -- linking both outcome measures. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight a cautionary tale: integration can improve asymptotic efficiency only under the strongest assumption linking the outcomes. However, misspecification of this assumption leads to bias. In contrast, a milder assumption may yield finite-sample efficiency gains, yet these benefits diminish as sample size increases. We illustrate these trade-offs via a case study integrating the XBOT and POAT datasets to estimate the comparative effect of two medications for opioid use disorder on withdrawal symptoms. By systematically varying the assumptions linking the SOW and COW scales, we show potential efficiency gains and the risks of bias. Our findings emphasize the need for careful assumption selection when fusing datasets with differing outcome measures, offering guidance for researchers navigating this common challenge in modern data integration.",

Nonetheless, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba Selective State Space Model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through adaptive expert routing. In the first level, a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) layer partitions input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second level aggregates these outputs through a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design, combining local expert routing with global expert refinement, enhances generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art results across datasets from the three most widely used 3D medical imaging modalities and varying data qualities.

In the fly olfactory circuit, both lateral inhibition (LI) and neuronal spike frequency adaptation (SFA) are thought to enhance pattern separation for odor learning. However, it remains unclear whether these mechanisms play redundant or distinct roles in this process. In this study, we present a computational model of the fly olfactory circuit to investigate odor discrimination under varying noise conditions that simulate complex environments. Our results show that LI primarily enhances odor discrimination in low‑ and medium‑noise scenarios, but this benefit diminishes and may reverse under higher‑noise conditions. In contrast, SFA consistently improves discrimination across all noise levels. LI is preferentially engaged in low‑ and medium‑noise environments, whereas SFA dominates in high‑noise settings. When combined, these two sparsification mechanisms enable optimal discrimination performance.  This work demonstrates that seemingly redundant modules in biological circuits can, in fact, be essential for achieving optimal learning in complex contexts.",

Real stochastic processes exhibit a degree of memory effects (correlations in time), long-range dependencies, roughness and anomalous diffusion phenomena that are not captured in standard diffusion or bridge modeling due to the use of Brownian motion (BM). As a remedy, leveraging a recent Markovian approximation (MA-fBM), we construct FDBM that enable tractable inference while preserving the non-Markovian nature of fBM. We prove that the resulting bridge is a coupling-preserving process and leverage it for future state prediction from paired training data. We then extend our formulation to the Schrödinger bridge problem and derive a principled loss function to learn the unpaired data translation. We evaluate FDBM on both tasks: predicting future protein conformations from aligned data, and unpaired image translation. In both settings, FDBM achieves superior performance compared to the Brownian baselines, yielding lower root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of C$_\\alpha$ atomic positions in protein structure prediction and lower Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) in unpaired image translation.",

Yet, training still treats these logits in isolation—either supervising only the final, highest‑resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss weights at every scale—without exploring *mixed‑scale* combinations. Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce LoMix ($\\underline{Lo}$gits $\\underline{Mix}$ing), a Neural Architecture Search (NAS)‑inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that **generates** new mixed‑scale outputs and **learns** how exactly each of them should guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication, concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of synthetic “mutant’’ maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss weight that is co‑optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one‑step architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales, mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures (i.e., PVT‑V2‑B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8‑organ dataset improves DICE by +4.2\\% over single‑output supervision, +2.2\\% over deep supervision, and +1.5\\% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with **zero** inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled scans, 5\\% of the trainset), the advantage grows to +9.23\\%, underscoring LoMix’s data efficiency. Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up to +13.5\\% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted mixed‑scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully interpretable, and overhead-free at inference.

    "abstract": "Decoding visual signals holds an appealing potential to unravel the complexities of cognition and perception. While recent reconstruction tasks leverage powerful generative models to produce high-fidelity images from neural recordings, they often pay limited attention to the underlying neural representations and rely heavily on pretrained priors. As a result, they provide little insight into how individual voxels encode and differentiate semantic content or how these representations vary across subjects. To mitigate this gap, we present an $i$nsightful **M**ulti-subject **I**nvariant **N**eural **D**ecoding ($i$MIND) model, which employs a novel dual-decoding framework--both biometric and semantic decoding--to offer neural interpretability in a data-driven manner and deepen our understanding of brain-based visual functionalities. Our $i$MIND model operates through three core steps: establishing a shared neural representation space across subjects using a ViT-based masked autoencoder, disentangling neural features into complementary subject-specific and object-specific components, and performing dual decoding to support both biometric and semantic classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that $i$MIND achieves state-of-the-art decoding performance with minimal scalability limitations. Furthermore, $i$MIND empirically generates voxel-object activation fingerprints that reveal object-specific neural patterns and enable investigation of subject-specific variations in attention to identical stimuli. These findings provide a foundation for more interpretable and generalizable subject-invariant neural decoding, advancing our understanding of the voxel semantic selectivity as well as the neural vision processing dynamics.",

We introduce $\\textbf{LUNA}$ ($\\textbf{L}$atent $\\textbf{U}$nified $\\textbf{N}$etwork $\\textbf{A}$rchitecture), a self-supervised foundation model that reconciles disparate electrode geometries while scaling linearly---not quadratically---with channel count. LUNA compresses multi-channel EEG into a fixed-size, topology-agnostic latent space via learned queries and cross-attention. Downstream transformer blocks then operate exclusively on this latent representation using patch-wise temporal self-attention, decoupling computation from electrode count. Pre-trained on TUEG and Siena ($\\>$21,000 h raw EEG across diverse montages) using a masked-patch reconstruction objective, LUNA transfers effectively to four downstream tasks: abnormality detection, artifact rejection, slowing classification, and emotion recognition. It demonstrates highly competitive performance across several benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on TUAR and TUSL, e.g., $\\textbf{0.921 AUROC}$ on TUAR, while reducing FLOPs by $\\textbf{300}$$\\times$ and trimming GPU memory use by up to $\\textbf{10}$$\\times$.

However, extracting these preserved dynamics remains challenging: high-dimensional neural population activity and the recorded neuron populations vary across recording sessions. While existing modeling tools can improve alignment between neural and behavioral data, they often operate on a per-subject basis or discretize behavior into categories, disrupting its natural continuity and failing to capture the underlying dynamics. We introduce $\\underline{\\text{C}}$ontrastive $\\underline{\\text{A}}$ligned $\\underline{\\text{N}}$eural $\\underline{\\text{D}}$$\\underline{\\text{Y}}$namics (CANDY), an end‑to‑end framework that aligns neural and behavioral data using rank-based contrastive learning, adapted for continuous behavioral variables, to project neural activity from different sessions onto a shared low-dimensional embedding space. CANDY fits a shared linear dynamical system to the aligned embeddings, enabling an interpretable model of the conserved temporal structure in the latent space. We validate CANDY on synthetic and real-world datasets spanning multiple species, behaviors, and recording modalities. Our results show that CANDY is able to learn aligned latent embeddings and preserved dynamics across neural recording sessions and subjects, and it achieves improved cross-session behavior decoding performance. We further show that the latent linear dynamical system generalizes to new sessions and subjects, achieving comparable or even superior behavior decoding performance to models trained from scratch. These advances enable robust cross‑session behavioral decoding and offer a path towards identifying shared neural dynamics that underlie behavior across individuals and recording conditions.

However, despite recent advances in 3D generative modeling, particularly in improving docking scores, these methods often produce rare and intrinsically irrational molecular structures that deviate from drug-like chemical space. To quantify this issue, we propose a novel metric, the Molecule Reasonable Ratio (MRR), which measures structural rationality and reveals a critical gap between existing models and real-world approved drugs. To address this, we introduce the Collaborative Intelligence Drug Design (CIDD) framework, the first approach to unify the 3D interaction modeling capabilities of generative models with the general knowledge and reasoning power of large language models (LLMs). By leveraging LLM-based Chain-of-Thought reasoning, CIDD generates molecules that not only bind effectively to protein pockets but also exhibit strong structural drug-likeness, rationality, and synthetic accessibility. On the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, CIDD consistently improves drug-likeness metrics, including QED, SA, and MRR, across different base generative models, while maintaining competitive binding affinity. Notably, it raises the combined success rate (balancing drug-likeness and binding) from 15.72% to 34.59%, more than doubling previous results. These findings demonstrate the value of integrating knowledge reasoning with geometric generation to advance AI-driven drug design.",

However, introducing bias terms creates a severe efficiency bottleneck in attention computation. It disrupts the tightly fused memory-compute pipeline that underlies the speed of accelerators like FlashAttention, thereby stripping away most of their performance gains and leaving biased attention computationally expensive. Surprisingly, despite its common usage, targeted efficiency optimization for attention with bias remains absent, which seriously hinders its application in complex tasks. Diving into the computation of FlashAttention, we prove that its optimal efficiency is determined by the rank of the attention weight matrix. Inspired by this theoretical result, this paper presents FlashBias based on the low-rank compressed sensing theory, which can provide fast-exact computation for many widely used attention biases and a fast-accurate approximation for biases in general formalizations. FlashBias can fully take advantage of the extremely optimized matrix multiplication operation in modern GPUs, achieving 1.5$\\times$ speedup for Pairformer in AlphaFold 3, and over 2$\\times$ speedup for attention with bias in vision and language models without loss of accuracy.

We introduce $\\texttt{DiPro}$, a novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static (anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs, prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate that $\\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification and general ICU prediction tasks.",

We trace much of these errors to mismatched cross‑user signal statistics, fragile reliance on high‑order feature dependencies, and the absence of architectural inductive biases aligned with the bilateral nature of typing. To address these issues, we introduce three simple modifications: (i) Rolling Time Normalization which adaptively aligns input distributions across users; (ii) Aggressive Channel Masking, which encourages reliance on low‑order feature combinations more likely to generalize across users; and (iii) a Split‑and‑Share encoder that processes each hand independently with weight‑shared streams to reflect the bilateral symmetry of the neuromuscular system. \nCombined with a five‑fold reduction in spectral resolution (33$\\rightarrow$6 frequency bands), these components yield a compact Split-and-Share model, SplashNet‑mini, which uses only ¼ the parameters and 0.6× the FLOPs of the baseline while reducing character error rate (CER) to 36.4\\% zero‑shot and 5.9\\% after fine‑tuning.

The collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However, the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of perturbations (e.g. small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models, demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant reductions in computation time.

Manipulating this activity using brain stimulation techniques has great potential for scientific and clinical applications, as it provides a tool to causally influence brain function. To improve the accuracy by which one can manipulate neural activity, it is important to (1) take into account the pre-stimulation brain state, which can influence the brain’s response to stimulation, and (2) adaptively update stimulation parameters over time to compensate for changes in the brain’s response to stimulation. In this work, we propose Online MicroStimulation Optimization (OMiSO), a brain stimulation framework that leverages brain state information to find stimulation parameters that can drive neural population activity toward specified states. OMiSO includes two key advances: i) training a stimulation-response model that leverages the pre-stimulation brain state, and inverting this model to choose the stimulation parameters, and ii) updating this inverse model online using newly-observed responses to stimulation. We tested OMiSO using intracortical microstimulation with a ``Utah'' array and found that it outperformed competing methods that do not incorporate these advances. Taken together, OMiSO provides greater accuracy in achieving specified activity states, thereby advancing neuromodulation technologies for understanding the brain and for treating brain disorders.",

Practitioners commonly make decisions by checking whether the estimated CATE is positive, even though the decision-making performance of modern CATE estimators is poorly understood from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we study optimal decision-making based on two-stage CATE estimators (e.g., DR-learner), which are considered state-of-the-art and widely used in practice. We prove that, while such estimators may be optimal for estimating CATE, they can be suboptimal when used for decision-making. Intuitively, this occurs because such estimators prioritize CATE accuracy in regions far away from the decision boundary, which is ultimately irrelevant to decision-making. As a remedy, we propose a novel two-stage learning objective that retargets the CATE to balance CATE estimation error and decision performance. We then propose a neural method that optimizes an adaptively-smoothed approximation of our learning objective. Finally, we confirm the effectiveness of our method both empirically and theoretically. In sum, our work is the first to show how state-of-the-art CATE estimators can be adapted for optimal decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory network inference (GRNI) aims to discover how genes causally regulate each other from gene expression data. It is well-known that statistical dependencies in observed data do not necessarily imply causation, as spurious dependencies may arise from *latent confounders*, such as non-coding RNAs. Numerous GRNI methods have thus been proposed to address this confounding issue. However, dependencies may also result from *selection*&mdash;only cells satisfying certain survival or inclusion criteria are observed&mdash;while these selection-induced spurious dependencies are frequently overlooked in gene expression data analyses. In this work, we show that such selection is ubiquitous and, when ignored or conflated with true regulations, can lead to flawed causal interpretation and misguided intervention recommendations. To address this challenge, a fundamental question arises: can we distinguish dependencies due to regulation, confounding, and crucially, selection? We show that gene perturbations offer a simple yet effective answer: selection-induced dependencies are *symmetric* under perturbation, while those from regulation or confounding are not. Building on this motivation, we propose GISL (Gene regulatory network Inference in the presence of Selection bias and Latent confounders), a principled algorithm that leverages perturbation data to uncover both true gene regulatory relations and non-regulatory mechanisms of selection and confounding up to the equivalence class. Experiments on synthetic and real-world gene expression data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "The whole-slide pathology images (WSIs) are widely recognized as the golden standard for cancer survival analysis. However, due to the high-resolution of WSIs, the existing studies require dividing WSIs into patches and identify key components before building the survival prediction system, which is time-consuming and cannot reflect the overall spatial organization of WSIs. Inspired by the fact that the spatial interactions among different tumor microenvironment (TME) components in WSIs are associated with the cancer prognosis, some studies attempt to capture the complex interactions among different TME components to improve survival predictions. However, they require extra efforts for building the TME segmentation model, which involves substantial annotation workloads on different TME components and is independent to the construction of the survival prediction model. To address the above issues, we propose ZTSurv, a novel end-to-end cancer survival analysis framework via efficient zero-shot TME segmentation on low-resolution WSIs. Specifically, by leveraging tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) maps on the 50x down-sampled WSIs, ZTSurv enables zero-shot segmentation on other two important TME components (i.e., tumor and stroma) that can reduce the annotation efforts from the pathologists. Then, based on the visual and semantic information extracted from different TME components, we construct a heterogeneous graph to capture their spatial  intersections for clinical outcome prediction. We validate ZTSurv across four cancer cohorts derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the experimental results indicate that our method can not only achieve superior prediction results but also significantly reduce the computational costs in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.",

We find such emergent behaviors in biological vision models via large-scale contrastive vision-language training. To achieve this, we first curate TreeOfLife-200M, comprising 214 million images of living organisms, the largest and most diverse biological organism image dataset to date. We then train BioCLIP 2 on TreeOfLife-200M to distinguish different species. Despite the narrow training objective, BioCLIP 2 yields extraordinary accuracy when applied to various biological visual tasks such as habitat classification and trait prediction. We identify emergent properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At the inter-species level, the embedding distribution of different species aligns closely with functional and ecological meanings (e.g., beak sizes and habitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, the intra-species variations (e.g., life stages and sexes) are preserved and better separated in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions. We provide formal proof and analyses to explain why hierarchical supervision and contrastive objectives encourage these emergent properties. Crucially, our results reveal that these properties become increasingly significant with larger-scale training data, leading to a biologically meaningful embedding space.",

In this work, we prove general results---the first of their kind---by applying Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyse infinitely-wide neural networks trained until convergence and prove that the inclusion of just one Layer Norm (LN) fundamentally alters the induced NTK, transforming it into a bounded-variance kernel. As a result, the output of an infinitely wide network with at least one LN remains bounded, even on inputs far from the training data. In contrast, we show that a broad class of networks without LN can produce pathologically large outputs for certain inputs. We support these theoretical findings with empirical experiments on finite-width networks, demonstrating that while standard NNs often exhibit uncontrolled growth outside the training domain, a single LN layer effectively mitigates this instability. Finally, we explore real-world implications of this extrapolatory stability, including applications to predicting residue sizes in proteins larger than those seen during training and estimating age from facial images of underrepresented ethnicities absent from the training set.",

However, we observe that existing all-atom generation approaches suffering from an information shortcut issue, where models inadvertently infer sequences from side-chain information, compromising their ability to accurately learn sequence distributions. To address this, we introduce a novel rationalized information flow strategy to eliminate the information shortcut.

This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept  borrowed from mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and  with minimal, if any, adjustments to the architecture.

Many algorithms have been developed to tackle this problem, based on frameworks such as optimal transport and the Schrödinger bridge. A notable recent framework is Regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport (RUOT), which integrates both stochastic dynamics and unnormalized distributions.  However, since many existing methods do not explicitly enforce optimality conditions, their solutions often struggle to satisfy the principle of least action and meet challenges to converge in a stable and reliable way. To address these issues, we propose Variational RUOT (Var-RUOT), a new framework to solve the RUOT problem. By incorporating the optimal necessary conditions for the RUOT problem into both the parameterization of the search space and the loss function design, Var-RUOT only needs to learn a scalar field to solve the RUOT problem and can search for solutions with lower action. We also examined the challenge of selecting a growth penalty function in the widely used Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric and proposed a solution that better aligns with biological priors in Var-RUOT.  We validated the effectiveness of Var-RUOT on both simulated data and real single-cell datasets. Compared with existing algorithms, Var-RUOT can find solutions with lower action while exhibiting faster convergence and improved training stability.

    "abstract": "The design of biological sequences is essential for engineering functional biomolecules that contribute to advancements in human health and biotechnology. Recent advances in diffusion models, with their generative power and efficient conditional sampling, have made them a promising approach for sequence generation. To enhance model performance on limited data and enable multi-objective design and optimization, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has shown great potential. However, existing post-sampling and fine-tuning methods either lack stability in discrete optimization when avoiding gradients or incur high computational costs when employing gradient-based approaches, creating significant challenges for achieving both control and stability in the tuning process.\nTo address these limitations, we propose GLID$^2$E, a gradient-free RL-based tuning approach for discrete diffusion models. Our method introduces a clipped likelihood constraint to regulate the exploration space and implements reward shaping to better align the generative process with design objectives, ensuring a more stable and efficient tuning process. \nBy integrating these techniques, GLID$^2$E mitigates training instabilities commonly encountered in RL and diffusion-based frameworks, enabling robust optimization even in challenging biological design tasks. In the DNA sequence and protein sequence design systems, GLID$^2$E achieves competitive performance in function-based design while maintaining computational efficiency and a flexible tuning mechanism.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, neural network-guided heuristic search algorithms, such as Monte-Carlo tree search and A$^\\*$ search, have achieved significant advancements across diverse practical applications. Due to the challenges stemming from high state-space complexity, sparse training datasets, and incomplete environmental modeling, heuristic estimations manifest uncontrolled inherent biases towards the actual expected evaluations, thereby compromising the decision-making quality of search algorithms. Sampling exploration enhanced A$^\\*$ (SeeA$^\\*$) was proposed to improve the efficiency of A$^\\*$ search by constructing an dynamic candidate subset through random sampling, from which the expanded node was selected. However, uniform sampling strategy utilized by SeeA$^\\*$ facilitates exploration exclusively through the injection of randomness, which completely neglects the heuristic knowledge relevant to open nodes. Moreover, the theoretical support of cluster sampling remains ambiguous. Despite the existence of potential biases, heuristic estimations still encapsulate certain valuable information. In this paper, epistemic exploratory A$^\\*$ search (KeeA$^\\*$) is proposed to integrate heuristic knowledge for calibrating the sampling process. We first theoretically demonstrate that SeeA$^\\*$ with cluster sampling outperforms uniform sampling due to the distribution-aware selection with higher variance. Building on this insight, cluster scouting and path-aware sampling are introduced in KeeA$^\\*$ to further exploit heuristic knowledge to increase the sampling mean and variance, respectively, thereby generating higher-quality extreme candidates and enhancing overall decision-making performance. Finally, empirical results on retrosynthetic planning and logic synthesis demonstrate superior performance of KeeA$^*$ compared to state-of-the-art heuristic search algorithms.",

In this context, current machine learning approaches typically seek to establish direct mappings between structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) associated with specific cognitive states.\nHowever, these state-independent methods often yield inconsistent results due to overlapping brain networks across cognitive states. \nTo address this limitation, we conceptualize to uncover the dendritic coupling mechanism between one static SC and multiple FCs by solving a flow problem that bridges the distribution of SC to a mixed distribution of FCs, conditioned on various cognitive states, along a Riemannian manifold of symmetric positive-definite (SPD) manifold.\nWe further prove the equivalence between flow matching on the SPD manifold and on the computationally efficient Cholesky manifold. \nSince a spare of functional connections is shared across cognitive states, we introduce the notion of consensus control to promote the shared kinetic structures between multiple FC-to-SC pathways via synchronized coordination, yielding a biologically meaningful underpinning on SC-FC coupling mechanism.\nTogether, we present BrainFlow, a reversible generative model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on not only synthetic data but also large-scale neuroimaging datasets from UK Biobank and Human Connectome Project.",

    "abstract": "Computational methods for learning to sample from the Boltzmann distribution—where the target distribution is known only up to an unnormalized energy function—have advanced significantly recently. Due to the lack of explicit target samples, however, prior diffusion-based methods, known as _diffusion samplers_, often require importance-weighted estimation or complicated learning processes. Both trade off scalability with extensive evaluations of the energy and model, thereby limiting their practical usage. In this work, we propose **Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Sampler (ASBS)**, a new diffusion sampler that employs simple and scalable matching-based objectives yet without the need to estimate target samples during training. ASBS is grounded on a mathematical model—the Schrödinger Bridge—which enhances sampling efficiency via kinetic-optimal transportation. Through a new lens of stochastic optimal control theory, we demonstrate how SB-based diffusion samplers can be learned at scale via Adjoint Matching and prove convergence to the global solution. Notably, ASBS generalizes the recent Adjoint Sampling (Havens et al., 2025) to arbitrary source distributions by relaxing the so-called memoryless condition that largely restricts the design space. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ASBS on sampling from classical energy functions, amortized conformer generation, and molecular Boltzmann distributions.

In the second stage it uses a UCB-style subroutine (\"WarmStart-UCB\") to request labels from each stratum round-by-round. Both the main algorithm's and the subroutine's convergence rates are minimax optimal in classical settings.

However, the subtle appearance of lesions in NCCT and the difficulty of jointly modeling lesion detection and malignancy classification pose unique challenges.\nIn this work, we propose Dual-Res Tandem Mamba-3D (DRT-M3D), a novel multitask framework for opportunistic breast cancer analysis on NCCT scans. DRT-M3D introduces a dual-resolution architecture, which captures fine-grained spatial details for segmentation-based lesion detection and global contextual features for breast-level cancer classification. It further incorporates a tandem input mechanism that models bilateral breast regions jointly through Mamba-3D blocks, enabling cross-breast feature interaction by leveraging subtle asymmetries between the two sides. \nOur approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks across multi-institutional NCCT datasets spanning four medical centers.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models are typically trained on datasets collected from the web, which may inadvertently contain harmful or sensitive personal information. To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact unlearning---which retrains the model from scratch without the target data---is widely regarded as the gold standard for mitigating privacy risks in deployment. In this paper, we revisit this assumption in a practical deployment setting where both the pre- and post-unlearning logits API are exposed, such as in open-weight scenarios. Targeting this setting, we introduce a novel data extraction attack that leverages signals from the pre-unlearning model to guide the post-unlearning model, uncovering patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves extraction success rates---doubling performance in some cases---across common benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, \\textit{increase} the risk of privacy leakage during real-world deployments, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints.

Recent advances in steering protein generative models (e.g., diffusion models and language models) with labeled data offer a promising approach. However, most previous studies have optimized surrogate rewards and/or utilized large amounts of labeled data for steering, making it unclear how well existing methods perform and compare to each other in real-world optimization campaigns where fitness is measured through low-throughput wet-lab assays. In this study, we explore fitness optimization using small amounts (hundreds) of labeled sequence-fitness pairs and comprehensively evaluate strategies such as classifier guidance and posterior sampling for guiding generation from different discrete diffusion models of protein sequences. We also demonstrate how guidance can be integrated into adaptive sequence selection akin to Thompson sampling in Bayesian optimization, showing that plug-and-play guidance strategies offer advantages over alternatives such as reinforcement learning with protein language models. Overall, we provide practical insights into how to effectively steer modern generative models for next-generation protein fitness optimization.",

    "abstract": "In computational neuroscience, models representing single-neuron in-vivo activity have become essential for understanding the functional identities of individual neurons. These models, such as implicit representation methods based on Transformer architectures, contrastive learning frameworks, and variational autoencoders, aim to capture the invariant and intrinsic computational features of single neurons. The learned single-neuron computational role representations should remain invariant across changing environment and are affected by their molecular expression and location. Thus, the representations allow for in vivo prediction of the molecular cell types and anatomical locations of single neurons, facilitating advanced closed-loop experimental designs. However, current models face the problem of limited generalizability. This is due to batch effects caused by differences in experimental design, animal subjects, and recording platforms. These confounding factors often lead to overfitting, reducing the robustness and practical utility of the models across various experimental scenarios. Previous studies have not rigorously evaluated how well the models generalize to new animals or stimulus conditions, creating a significant gap in the field. To solve this issue, we present a comprehensive experimental protocol that explicitly evaluates model performance on unseen animals and stimulus types. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic adversarial training strategy. In this strategy, a discriminator network is used to eliminate batch-related information from the learned representations. The adversarial framework forces the representation model to focus on the intrinsic properties of neurons, thereby enhancing generalizability. Our approach is compatible with all major single-neuron representation models and significantly improves model robustness. This work emphasizes the importance of generalization in single-neuron representation models and offers an effective solution, paving the way for the practical application of computational models in vivo. It also shows potential for building unified atlases based on single-neuron in vivo activity.",

Despite notable advances in recent years, existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are confronted with several key challenges: (1) current datasets and methods are centered on individual protein–ligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may exist across multiple complexes of the same protein, introducing significant statistical bias; (2) ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as a discontinuous workflow, employing binary segmentation and subsequent clustering algorithms; (3) traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect the actual performance of different binding site prediction methods. To address these issues, we first introduce UniSite-DS, the first UniProt (Unique Protein)-centric ligand binding site dataset, which contains 4.81 times more multi-site data and 2.08 times more overall data compared to the previously most widely used datasets. We then propose UniSite, the first end-to-end ligand binding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss with bijective matching. In addition, we introduce Average Precision based on Intersection over Union (IoU) as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligand binding site prediction. Extensive experiments on UniSite-DS and several representative benchmark datasets demonstrate that IoU-based Average Precision provides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality, and that UniSite outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in ligand binding site detection.

This setting is particularly relevant in practical imaging scenarios involving specialized domains such as  medical imaging or biology. In this work, we propose the *Zero-Shot Neural Compression Denoiser* (ZS-NCD), a novel denoising framework based on neural compression. ZS-NCD treats a neural compression network as an untrained model, optimized directly on patches extracted from a single noisy image. The final reconstruction is then obtained by aggregating the outputs of the trained model over overlapping patches. Thanks to the built-in entropy constraints of compression architectures, our method naturally avoids overfitting and does not require manual regularization or early stopping. Through extensive experiments, we show that ZS-NCD achieves state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot denoisers for both Gaussian and Poisson noise, and generalizes well to both natural and non-natural images. Additionally, we provide new finite-sample theoretical results that characterize upper bounds on the achievable reconstruction error of general maximum-likelihood compression-based denoisers. These results further establish the theoretical foundations of compression-based denoising. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Computational-Imaging-RU/ZS-NCDenoiser.",

One prominent issue is inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, which tend to overestimate oxygen saturation for dark-skinned patients and misrepresent supplemental oxygen needs. Most existing research has revealed *statistical disparities* linking device measurement errors to patient outcomes in intensive care units (ICUs) without causal formalization. This study *causally* investigates how racial discrepancies in oximetry measurements affect invasive ventilation in ICU settings. We employ a causal inference-based approach using *path-specific effects* to isolate the impact of bias by race on clinical decision-making. To estimate these effects, we leverage a doubly robust estimator, propose its self-normalized variant for improved sample efficiency, and provide novel finite-sample guarantees. Our methodology is validated on semi-synthetic data and applied to two large real-world health datasets: MIMIC-IV and eICU. Contrary to prior work, our analysis reveals minimal impact of racial discrepancies on invasive ventilation rates. However, path-specific effects mediated by oxygen saturation disparity are more pronounced on ventilation duration, and the severity differs by dataset. Our work provides a novel pipeline for investigating potential disparities in clinical decision-making and, more importantly, highlights the necessity of causal methods to robustly assess fairness in healthcare.",

In recent years, the combination of external controls has gained increasing attention as a means of improving the efficiency of RCTs.

In this paper, we propose a novel influence-based adaptive sample borrowing approach that effectively quantifies the \"comparability'' of each sample in the external controls using influence function theory. Given a selected set of borrowed external controls, we further derive a semiparametric efficient estimator under an exchangeability assumption. Recognizing that the exchangeability assumption may not hold for all possible borrowing sets, we conduct a detailed analysis of the asymptotic bias and variance of the proposed estimator under violations of exchangeability. Building on this bias-variance trade-off, we further develop a data-driven approach to select the optimal subset of external controls for borrowing. Extensive simulations and real-world applications demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances treatment effect estimation efficiency in RCTs, outperforming existing approaches.",

Most existing literature assume Brownian reference dynamics, and are implicitly limited to modelling systems driven by the gradient of a potential energy. We depart from this regime and consider reference processes described by a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with generic drift matrix $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$. When $\\mathbf{A}$ is asymmetric, this corresponds to a non-equilibrium system in which non-gradient forces are at play: this is important for applications to biological systems, which naturally exist out-of-equilibrium. In the case of Gaussian marginals, we derive explicit expressions that characterise exactly the solution of both the static and dynamic Schrödinger bridge. For general marginals, we propose mvOU-OTFM, a simulation-free algorithm based on flow and score matching for learning an approximation to the Schrödinger bridge. In application to a range of problems based on synthetic and real single cell data, we demonstrate that mvOU-OTFM achieves higher accuracy compared to competing methods, whilst being significantly faster to train.",

Our method leverages sieve-based Q-function estimation and (high-dimensional) Gaussian approximation techniques over convex regions, which further motivates a new multiplier bootstrap algorithm for constructing asymptotically correct simultaneous confidence regions (SCRs).

To accelerate algorithmic progress, a recent benchmark released intracranial recordings from a paralyzed participant attempting to speak, along with a baseline decoding algorithm. Prior work on the benchmark showed impressive accuracy gains. However, these gains increased computational costs and were not demonstrated in a real-time decoding setting. Here, we make three contributions that pave the way towards accurate, efficient, and real-time neural speech decoding. First, we incorporate large amounts of time-masking during training. On average, over $50\\%$ of each trial is masked. Second, we replace the gated recurrent unit (GRU) architecture used in the baseline algorithm with a compact Transformer. The Transformer architecture uses $83\\%$ fewer parameters, cuts peak GPU memory usage by $52\\%$ relative, and is significantly faster to calibrate relative to the GRU. Third, we design a lightweight variant of an existing test-time adaptation method developed for decoding handwriting from neural activity. Our variant adapts the model using multiple time-masked augmentations of a single trial and requires only one gradient step per trial. Together, these contributions reduce word error rate by $20\\%$ and effectively mitigate performance degradations across held-out days in a real-time decoding setting while substantially lowering computational costs.",

Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE, the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE) prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts, underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for more robust, equitable prognostic models.",

However, this task is challenging in survival analysis, which includes time-to-event data with censored outcomes (e.g., due to study dropout). In this paper, we propose a toolbox of orthogonal survival learners to estimate HTEs from time-to-event data under censoring. Our learners have three main advantages: (i) we show that learners from our toolbox are guaranteed to be orthogonal and thus robust with respect to nuisance estimation errors; (ii) our toolbox allows for incorporating a custom weighting function, which can lead to robustness against different types of low overlap, and (iii) our learners are \\emph{model-agnostic} (i.e., they can be combined with arbitrary machine learning models). We instantiate the learners from our toolbox using several weighting functions and, as a result, propose various neural orthogonal survival learners. Some of these coincide with existing survival learners (including survival versions of the DR- and R-learner), while others are novel and further robust w.r.t. low overlap regimes specific to the survival setting (i.e., survival overlap and censoring overlap). We then empirically verify the effectiveness of our learners for HTE estimation in different low-overlap regimes through numerical experiments. In sum, we provide practitioners with a large toolbox of learners that can be used for randomized and observational studies with censored time-to-event data.",

    "abstract": "Encoding models based on word embeddings or artificial neural network (ANN) features reliably predict brain responses to naturalistic stimuli but remain difficult to interpret. A central limitation is superposition—the entanglement of distinct semantic features along correlated directions in dense embeddings, which arises when latent features outnumber the embedding dimensions. This entanglement renders regression weights non-identifiable: different combinations of semantic directions can produce identical predicted brain activity, preventing principled interpretation of voxel selectivity. To overcome this, we introduce the Sparse Concept Encoding Model, which transforms dense embeddings into a higher-dimensional, sparse, and non-negative space of learned concept atoms. This transformation yields an axis-aligned semantic basis where each dimension corresponds to an interpretable concept, enabling direct readout of conceptual selectivity from voxel weights. When applied to fMRI data collected during story listening, our model matches the prediction performance of conventional dense models while substantially enhancing interpretability. It enables novel neuroscientific analyses such as disentangling overlapping cortical representations of time, space, and number, and revealing structured similarity among distributed conceptual maps. This framework offers a scalable and interpretable bridge between ANN-derived features and human conceptual representations in the brain.",

However, neural responses exhibit substantial trial-to-trial variability, often driven by unobserved factors such as subtle changes in animal behavior or internal states. To prevent evolving background dynamics from contaminating identification of functional coupling, we developed a hybrid neural spike train model, GLM-Transformer, that incorporates flexible, deep latent variable models into a point process generalized linear model (GLM) having an interpretable component for cross-population interactions. A Transformer-based variational autoencoder captures nonstationary individual-neuron dynamics that vary across trials, while standard nonparametric regression GLM coupling terms provide estimates of directed interactions between neural populations. We incorporate a low-rank structure on population-to-population coupling effects to improve scalability. Across synthetic datasets and mechanistic simulations, GLM-Transformer recovers known coupling structure and remains robust to shared background fluctuations. When applied to the Allen Institute Visual Coding dataset, it identifies feedforward pathways consistent with established visual hierarchies. This work offers a step toward improved identification of neural population interactions, and contributes to ongoing efforts aimed at achieving interpretable results while harvesting the benefits of deep learning.",

Indeed, prior empirical work has already shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the class-conditional ImageNet $256\\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in $23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA.",

However, predicting multiple fine-grained states of scene at multiple temporal scales is difficult for vision-language models.\nWe formalize the Multi‐Scale Temporal Prediction (MSTP) task in general and surgical scene by decomposing multi‐scale into two orthogonal dimensions: the temporal scale, forecasting states of human and surgery at varying look‐ahead intervals, and the state scale, modeling a hierarchy of states in general and surgical scene. For instance in general scene, states of contacting relationship are finer-grained than states of spatial relationship. For instance in surgical scene, medium‐level steps are finer‐grained than high‐level phases yet remain constrained by their encompassing phase. \nTo support this unified task, we introduce the first MSTP Benchmark, featuring synchronized annotations across multiple state scales and temporal scales. We further propose a novel method, Incremental Generation and Multi‐agent Collaboration (IG-MC), which integrates two key innovations. Firstly, we propose an plug-and-play incremental generation to keep high-quality temporal prediction that continuously synthesizes up-to-date visual previews at expanding temporal scales to inform multiple decision-making agents, ensuring decision content and generated visuals remain synchronized and preventing performance degradation as look‐ahead intervals lengthen.\nSecondly, we propose a decision‐driven multi‐agent collaboration framework for multiple states prediction, comprising generation, initiation, and multi‐state assessment agents that dynamically triggers and evaluates prediction cycles to balance global coherence and local fidelity. Extensive experiments on the MSTP Benchmark in general and surgical scene show that IG‐MC is a generalizable plug-and-play method for MSTP, demonstrating the effectiveness of incremental generation and the stability of decision‐driven multi‐agent collaboration.",

Current approaches typically rely on external anatomical information, from atlas-based planning to post hoc histology, which are limited in precision, longitudinal applicability, and real-time feedback. In this work, we develop a self-supervised learning framework, Lfp2vec, to infer anatomical regions directly from the neural signal in vivo. We adapt an audio-pretrained transformer model by continuing self-supervised training on a large corpus of unlabeled local-field-potential (LFP) data, then fine-tuning for anatomical region decoding. Ablations show that combining out-of-domain initialization with in-domain self-supervision outperforms training from scratch. We demonstrate that our method  achieves strong zero-shot generalization across different labs and probe geometries, and outperforming state-of-the-art self-supervised models on electrophysiology data. The learned embeddings form anatomically coherent clusters and transfer effectively to downstream tasks like disease classification with minimal fine-tuning. Altogether, our approach enables zero-shot prediction of brain regions in novel subjects, demonstrates that LFP signals encode rich anatomical information, and establishes self-supervised learning on raw LFP as a foundation to learn representations that can be tuned for diverse neural decoding tasks.

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the sequence of reactions that synthesize a desired target molecule. Due to the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant prediction—i.e., single-step retrosynthesis—remains difficult, even for state-of-the-art template-free generative methods. These models often struggle to produce an accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions in a chemically rational manner. In this paper, we propose RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF), a discrete flow-matching framework that formulates single-step retrosynthesis as a Markov bridge between a given product molecule and its corresponding reactants. Unlike prior approaches, RSF introduces a reaction center identification step to extract intermediate structures, or synthons, which serve as a more informative and structured source distribution for the discrete flow model. To further improve the diversity and chemical feasibility of generated samples, RSF incorporates Feynman-Kac (FK) steering with Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) resampling at inference time. This approach leverages a learned forward-synthesis reward oracle to guide the generation process toward more promising reactant candidates. Empirically, RSF substantially outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in top-1 accuracy. In addition, FK-steering significantly improves round-trip accuracy, demonstrating stronger chemical validity and synthetic feasibility, all while maintaining competitive top-k performance. These results establish RSF as a new leading approach for single-step retrosynthesis prediction.",

    "abstract": "3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. \nIn this work, we propose **U**nified Variational **A**uto-**E**ncoder for **3D** Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (**UAE-3D**), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both *de novo* and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality. On GEOM-Drugs, it reduces FCD by 72.6% over the previous best result, while achieving over 70% relative average improvements in geometric fidelity.

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining.\nA total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining.\nExperiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities.

Platforms such as ImageJ (Fiji) and napari have enabled the development of customized plugins for various models. However, these plugins are typically based on models that are limited to specific tasks and datasets, making them less practical for biologists. To address this challenge, we introduce **Orochi**, the first application-oriented, efficient, and versatile image processor designed to overcome these limitations. Orochi is pre-trained on patches/volumes extracted from the raw data of over 100 publicly available studies using our Random Multi-scale Sampling strategy. We further propose Task-related Joint-embedding Pre-Training (TJP), which employs biomedical task-related degradation for self-supervision rather than relying on Masked Image Modelling (MIM), which performs poorly in downstream tasks such as registration. To ensure computational efficiency, we leverage Mamba's linear computational complexity and construct Multi-head Hierarchy Mamba. Additionally, we provide a three-tier fine-tuning framework (Full, Normal, and Light) and demonstrate that Orochi achieves comparable or superior performance to current state-of-the-art specialist models, even with lightweight parameter-efficient options. We hope that our study contributes to the development of an all-in-one workflow, thereby relieving biologists from the overwhelming task of selecting among numerous models. Our pre-trained weights and code will be released.",

    "abstract": "Autoregressive models have transformed protein engineering by enabling the generation of novel protein sequences beyond those found in nature. However, their sequential inference introduces significant latency, limiting their utility in high-throughput protein screening. Speculative decoding accelerates generation by employing a lightweight draft model to sample tokens, which a larger target model then verifies and refines. Yet in protein sequence generation, draft models are typically agnostic to the structural and functional constraints of the target protein, leading to biologically implausible outputs and a shift in the likelihood distribution of generated sequences. We introduce SpecMER (Speculative Decoding via k-mer Guidance), a novel framework that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. By scoring candidate sequences in parallel and selecting those most consistent with known biological patterns, SpecMER significantly improves sequence plausibility while retaining the efficiency of speculative decoding. SpecMER achieves 24–32% speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance rates and improved sequence likelihoods.",

This results in sampling complexity and sequence lengths that scale optimally linearly with the number of edges, making it scalable and efficient for large, sparse graphs. A key success factor of AutoGraph is that its sequence prefixes represent induced subgraphs, creating a direct link to sub-sentences in language modeling. Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and molecular benchmarks, with up to 100x faster generation and 3x faster training than leading diffusion models. It also supports substructure-conditioned generation without fine-tuning and shows promising transferability, bridging language modeling and graph generation to lay the groundwork for graph foundation models.

However, extending the success of re-mask decoding from 2D to 3D MGM is non-trivial, primarily due to two conflicting challenges: avoiding 2D structure leakage to the decoder, while still providing sufficient 2D context for reconstructing re-masked atoms. To address these challenges, we propose 3D-GSRD: a 3D Molecular Graph Auto-Encoder with Selective Re-mask Decoding. The core innovation of 3D-GSRD lies in its  Selective Re-mask Decoding (SRD), which re-masks only 3D-relevant information from encoder representations while preserving the 2D graph structures. \n  This SRD is synergistically integrated with a 3D Relational-Transformer (3D-ReTrans) encoder alongside a structure-independent decoder. We analyze that SRD, combined with the structure-independent decoder, enhances the encoder's role in MRL. Extensive experiments show that 3D-GSRD achieves strong downstream performance, setting a new state-of-the-art on 7 out of 8 targets in the widely used MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark.

We introduce SiriuS, a self-improving, reasoning-driven optimization framework for multi-agent systems. Central to our approach is the construction of an experience library: a repository of high-quality reasoning trajectories. The library is built by retaining reasoning steps that lead to successful outcomes, providing a robust training set for optimizing multi-agent system. Additionally, we introduce a library augmentation procedure that refines unsuccessful trajectories, further enriching the library. SiriuS boosts performance by 2.86% to 21.88% on reasoning and biomedical QA and enhances agent negotiation in competitive settings.

    "abstract": "Spatial location and molecular interactions have long been linked to the connectivity patterns of neural circuits. Yet, at the macroscale of human brain networks, the interplay between spatial position, gene expression, and connectivity remains incompletely understood. Recent efforts to map the human transcriptome and connectome have yielded spatially resolved brain atlases, however modeling the relationship between high-dimensional transcriptomic data and connectivity while accounting for inherent spatial confounds presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the first deep learning approaches for predicting whole-brain functional connectivity from gene expression and regional spatial coordinates, including our proposed Spatiomolecular Transformer (SMT). SMT explicitly models biological context by tokenizing genes based on their transcription start site (TSS) order to capture multi-scale genomic organization, and incorporating regional 3D spatial location via a dedicated context [CLS] token within its multi-head self-attention mechanism. We rigorously benchmark context-aware neural networks, including SMT and a single-gene resolution Multilayer-Perceptron (MLP), to established rules-based and bilinear methods. Crucially, to ensure that learned relationships in any model are not mere artifacts of spatial proximity, we introduce novel  spatiomolecular null maps, preserving both spatial and transcriptomic autocorrelation. Context-aware neural networks outperform linear methods, significantly exceed our stringent null shuffle models, and generalize across diverse connectomic datasets and parcellation resolutions. Together, these findings demonstrate a strong, predictable link between the spatial distributions of gene expression and functional brain network architecture, and establish a rigorously validated deep learning framework for decoding this relationship.

Meanwhile, AlphaFold3-like protein folding models, pre-trained on a large corpus of crystal structures, have acquired a broad understanding of biomolecular interaction. Based on this insight, we develop a new antigen-conditioned antibody design model by adapting the diffusion module of AlphaFold3-like models for sequence-structure co-diffusion. Specifically, we extend their structure diffusion module with a sequence diffusion head and fine-tune the entire protein folding model for antibody sequence-structure co-design. Our benchmark results show that sequence-structure co-diffusion models not only surpass state-of-the-art antibody design methods in performance but also maintain structure prediction accuracy comparable to the original folding model.

Traditional methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects. Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU). These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with DRG coding due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) nature of the task: pretraining corpora rarely contain private clinical or billing data. We introduce DRG-Sapphire, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for automated DRG coding from clinical notes. Built on Qwen2.5-7B and trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using rule-based rewards, DRG-Sapphire introduces a series of RL enhancements to address domain-specific challenges not seen in previous mathematical tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MIMIC-IV benchmark and generates physician-validated reasoning for DRG assignments, significantly enhancing explainability. Our study further sheds light on broader challenges of applying RL to knowledge-intensive, OOD tasks. We observe that RL performance scales approximately linearly with the logarithm of the number of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) examples, suggesting that RL effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the domain knowledge encoded in the base model. For OOD tasks like DRG coding, strong RL performance requires sufficient knowledge infusion prior to RL. Consequently, scaling SFT may be more effective and computationally efficient than scaling RL alone for such tasks.",

The rise of powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, has enabled active target discovery in partially observable environments by leveraging learned priors—probabilistic representations that capture underlying structure from data. With guidance from sequentially gathered task-specific observations, these models can progressively refine exploration and efficiently direct queries toward promising regions. However, in domains where learning a strong prior is infeasible due to extremely limited data or high sampling cost (such as rare species discovery, diagnostics for emerging diseases, etc.), these methods struggle to generalize. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach that enables effective active target discovery even in settings with uninformative priors, ensuring robust exploration and adaptability in complex real-world scenarios. Our framework is theoretically principled and draws inspiration from neuroscience to guide its design. Unlike black-box policies, our approach is inherently interpretable, providing clear insights into decision-making. Furthermore, it guarantees a strong, monotonic improvement in prior estimates with each new observation, leading to increasingly accurate sampling and reinforcing both reliability and adaptability in dynamic settings. Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across various domains, including species distribution modeling and remote sensing, we demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms baseline approaches.",

Standard machine learning methods often provide accurate predictions but offer limited insight into covariate-response relationships. And we show that existing methods for constructing confidence (or credible) intervals for associations can fail to provide nominal coverage in the face of model misspecification and nonrandom locations — despite both being essentially always present in spatial problems. We introduce a method that constructs valid frequentist confidence intervals for associations in spatial settings. Our method requires minimal assumptions beyond a form of spatial smoothness and a homoskedastic Gaussian error assumption. In particular, we do not require model correctness or covariate overlap between training and target locations. Our approach is the first to guarantee nominal coverage in this setting and outperforms existing techniques in both real and simulated experiments. Our confidence intervals are valid in finite samples when the noise of the Gaussian error is known, and we provide an asymptotically consistent estimation procedure for this noise variance when it is unknown.",

    "abstract": "From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we argue for modeling such heterogeneous data sources under the multimodal paradigm and introduce a new framework, MAESTRO. We introduce MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large (making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra- and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4% and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches, respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations—with up to 40% of missing modalities—MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement. Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.",

Recent literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically, through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical employs a shared matrix A for abstractive summarization, along with multiple isolated matrices B for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix A. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices B. Experimental results on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

    "abstract": "Dynamic functional brain networks (DFBNs) are powerful tools in neuroscience research. Recent studies reveal that DFBNs contain heterogeneous neural nodes with more extensive connections and more drastic temporal changes, which play pivotal roles in coordinating the reorganization of the brain. Moreover, the spatio-temporal patterns of these nodes are modulated by the brain's historical states. However, existing methods not only ignore the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of neural nodes, but also fail to effectively encode the temporal propagation mechanism of heterogeneous activities. These limitations hinder the deep exploration of spatio-temporal relationships within DFBNs, preventing the capture of abnormal neural heterogeneity caused by brain diseases. To address these challenges, this paper propose a neuro-heterogeneity guided temporal graph learning strategy (NeuroH-TGL).  Specifically, we first develop a spatio-temporal pattern decoupling module to disentangle DFBNs into topological consistency networks and temporal trend networks that align with the brain's operational mechanisms. Then, we introduce a heterogeneity mining module to identify pivotal heterogeneity nodes that drive brain reorganization from the two decoupled networks. Finally, we design temporal propagation graph convolution to simulate the influence of the historical states of heterogeneity nodes on the current topology, thereby flexibly extracting heterogeneous spatio-temporal information from the brain. Experiments show that our method surpasses several state-of-the-art methods, and can identify abnormal heterogeneous nodes caused by brain diseases.",

    "abstract": "Visual processing starts in the outer retina where photoreceptors transform light into electrochemical signals. These signals are modulated by inhibition from horizontal cells and sent to the inner retina via excitatory bipolar cells. The outer retina is thought to play an important role in contrast invariant coding of visual information, but how the different cell types implement this computation together remains incompletely understood. To understand the role of each cell type, we developed a fully-differentiable biophysical model of a circular patch of mouse outer retina. The model includes 200 cone photoreceptors with a realistic phototransduction cascade and ribbon synapses as well as horizontal and bipolar cells, all with cell-type specific ion channels. Going beyond decades of work constraining biophysical models of neurons only by experimental data, we used a dual approach, constraining some parameters of the model with available measurements and others by a visual task: (1) We fit the parameters of the cone models to whole cell patch-clamp measurements of photocurrents and two-photon glutamate imaging measurements of synaptic release. (2) We then trained the spatiotemporal outer retina model with photoreceptors and the other cell types to perform a visual classification task with varying contrast and luminance levels. We found that our outer retina model could learn to solve the classification task despite contrast and luminance variance in the stimuli. Testing different cell type compositions and connectivity patterns, we found that feedback from horizontal cells did not further improve task performance beyond that of excitatory photoreceptors and bipolar cells. This is surprising given that horizontal cells are positioned to mediate communication across cones and that they add to the model's number of trainable parameters. Finally, we found that our model generalized better to out of distribution contrast levels than a linear classifier. Our work shows how the nonlinearities found in the outer retina can accomplish contrast invariant classification and teases apart the contributions of different cell types.",

While consistency models have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM), which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori, spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3), spanning a variety of crucial real-world applications such as RNA and protein generation.",

While existing methods address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination models, they introduce  high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input, feature and output levels. \nFirst, we adopt modality reconstruction with the hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for missing modalities through cross-modal fusion.  \nNext, modality-invariant contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among incomplete-complete modality pairs.  Furthermore, the proposed lightweight reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation.

While prior work has studied property inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models) and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms: question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals.

Not accounting for such heterogeneity then risks biased estimates of  drug effectiveness.  \n In this work, we formulate this setting through a causal mixture model,\n in which the data-generating process of each variable depends on latent group membership (a or b). Specifically, we model each variable as a   mixture of structural causal equation models, where latent categorical (mixing) variables index assignment to subpopulations. Unlike prior work, the approach allows  for multiple independent mixing variables, each affecting distinct sets of observed variables. To infer both the graph, mixing variables, and assignments jointly, we integrate mixture modeling into score-based causal discovery; show theoretically that the resulting scoring criterion is consistent; and demonstrate  empirically that the resulting causal discovery approach discovers the causal model in synthetic and real-world evaluations.",

To generate diverse images reflecting this diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose \\modelnamenospace, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. \\modelname is based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition, leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images. Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate \\modelnamenospace’s improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.",

Recent studies show that autoregressive transformers often exhibit Markovian behavior by relying on fixed-length context windows for next-token prediction. However, standard self-attention mechanisms are computationally inefficient for long sequences due to their quadratic complexity and do not explicitly enforce global transition consistency.\n\nWe introduce CARMANIA (Context-Aware Regularization with Markovian Integration for Attention-Based Nucleotide Analysis), a self-supervised pretraining framework that augments next-token (NT) prediction with a transition-matrix (TM) loss. The TM loss aligns predicted token transitions with empirically derived n-gram statistics from each input sequence, encouraging the model to capture higher-order dependencies beyond local context. This integration enables CARMANIA to learn organism-specific sequence structures that reflect both evolutionary constraints and functional organization.\n\nWe evaluate  CARMANIA across diverse genomic tasks, including regulatory element prediction, functional gene classification, taxonomic inference, antimicrobial resistance detection, and biosynthetic gene cluster classification. CARMANIA outperforms the previous best long-context model by at least 7\\%, matches state-of-the-art on shorter sequences (exceeding prior results on 20/40 tasks while running $\\sim$2.5$\\times$ faster), and shows particularly strong improvements on enhancer and housekeeping gene classification tasks—including up to a 34\\% absolute gain in Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for enhancer prediction. The TM loss boosts accuracy in 33 of 40 tasks, especially where local motifs or regulatory patterns drive prediction. This enables more effective modeling of sequence-dependent biological features while maintaining robustness across non-coding and low-signal regions.

    "abstract": "Characterizing the cellular properties of  neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce $\\texttt{NOBLE}$, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, $\\texttt{NOBLE}$ predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. $\\texttt{NOBLE}$ enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200$× speedup over the numerical solver. $\\texttt{NOBLE}$ is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, $\\texttt{NOBLE}$ captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.",

However, existing methods are predominantly evaluated in isolation, i.e., one edit at a time, failing to consider a critical scenario of compositional model editing, where multiple edits must be integrated and jointly utilized to answer real-world multifaceted questions. For instance, in medical domains, if one edit informs LLMs that COVID-19 causes \"fever\" and another that it causes \"loss of taste\", a qualified compositional editor should enable LLMs to answer the question \"What are the symptoms of COVID-19?\" with both \"fever\" and \"loss of taste\" (and potentially more). In this work, we define and systematically benchmark this compositional model editing (CME) task, identifying three key undesirable issues that existing methods struggle with: *knowledge loss*, *incorrect preceding* and *knowledge sinking*. To overcome these issues, we propose A$^3$E, a novel compositional editor that (1) ***a**daptively combines and **a**daptively regularizes* pre-trained foundation knowledge in LLMs in the stage of edit training and (2) ***a**daptively merges* multiple edits to better meet compositional needs in the stage of edit composing.

We propose \\model{FAPEX}, a novel architecture that introduces a learnable \\emph{fractional neural frame operator} (FrNFO) for adaptive time–frequency decomposition. Unlike conventional models that exhibit spectral bias toward low frequencies, our FrNFO employs fractional-order convolutions to capture both high and low-frequency dynamics, achieving approximately $10\\%$ improvement in F1-score and sensitivity over state-of-the-art baselines. The FrNFO enables the extraction of \\emph{instantaneous phase and amplitude representations} that are particularly informative for preictal biomarker discovery and enhance out-of-distribution generalization. \\model{FAPEX} further integrates structural state-space modeling and channelwise attention, allowing it to handle heterogeneous electrode montages. Evaluated across 12 benchmarks spanning species (human, rat, dog, macaque) and modalities (Scalp‑EEG, SEEG, ECoG, LFP), \\model{FAPEX} consistently outperforms 23 supervised and 10 self-supervised baselines under nested cross-validation, with gains of up to $15\\%$ in sensitivity on complex cross-domain scenarios. It further demonstrates superior performance in several external validation cohorts.

While deep learning has advanced forecasting, generating calibrated probability distributions over continuous future values remains challenging. We introduce Temporal Generative Flow Networks (Temporal GFNs), adapting Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) – a powerful framework for generating compositional objects – to this sequential prediction task. GFNs learn policies to construct objects (eg. forecast trajectories) step-by-step, sampling final objects proportionally to a reward signal. However, applying GFNs directly to continuous time series necessitates addressing their inherently discrete action spaces and ensuring differentiability. Our framework tackles this by representing time series segments as states and sequentially generating future values via quantized actions chosen by a forward policy. We introduce two key innovations: (1) An adaptive, curriculum-based quantization strategy that dynamically adjusts the number of discretization bins based on reward improvement and policy entropy, balancing precision and exploration throughout training. (2) A straight-through estimator mechanism enabling the forward policy to output both discrete (hard) samples for trajectory construction and continuous (soft) samples for stable gradient propagation. Training utilizes a trajectory balance loss objective, ensuring flow consistency, augmented by an entropy regularizer. We provide rigorous theoretical bounds on the quantization error's impact and the adaptive factor's range. We demonstrate how Temporal GFNs offer a principled way to leverage the structured generation capabilities of GFNs for probabilistic forecasting in continuous domains.",

However, efficiently fine-tuning them for downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework (GeoAda) that enables flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks without modifying the original model architecture.  GeoAda introduces a structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected base model layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model’s geometric consistency while mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of \\method across diverse geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics, molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical results show that  GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting.",

We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow matching for discrete atom types. A protein–ligand interaction predictor is incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry. Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg.

    "abstract": "Computation in recurrent networks of neurons has been hypothesized to occur at the level of low-dimensional latent dynamics, both in artificial systems and in the brain. This hypothesis seems at odds with evidence from large-scale neuronal recordings in mice showing that neuronal population activity is high-dimensional. To demonstrate that low-dimensional latent dynamics and high-dimensional activity can be two sides of the same coin, we present an analytically solvable recurrent neural network (RNN) model whose dynamics can be exactly reduced to a low-dimensional dynamical system, but generates an activity manifold that has a high linear embedding dimension. This raises the question: Do low-dimensional latents explain the high-dimensional activity observed in mouse visual cortex? Spectral theory tells us that the covariance eigenspectrum alone does not allow us to recover the dimensionality of the latents, which can be low or high, when neurons are nonlinear. To address this indeterminacy, we develop Neural Cross-Encoder (NCE), an interpretable, nonlinear latent variable modeling method for neuronal recordings, and find that high-dimensional neuronal responses to drifting gratings and spontaneous activity in visual cortex can be reduced to low-dimensional latents, while the responses to natural images cannot. We conclude that the high-dimensional activity measured in certain conditions, such as in the absence of a stimulus, is explained by low-dimensional latents that are nonlinearly processed by individual neurons.",

    "abstract": "To enhance the generalization ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) in learning and simulation physical dynamics, a series of equivariant GNNs have been developed to incorporate the symmetric inductive bias. However, the existing methods do not take into account the non-stationarity nature of physical dynamics, where the joint distribution changes over time. Moreover, previous approaches for modeling non-stationary time series typically involve normalizing the data, which disrupts the symmetric assumption inherent in physical dynamics. To model the non-stationary physical dynamics while preserving the symmetric inductive bias, we introduce a Non-Stationary Equivariant Graph Neural Network (NS-EGNN) to capture the non-stationarity in physical dynamics while preserving the symmetric property of the model. Specifically, NS-EGNN employs Fourier Transform on segments of physical dynamics to extract time-varying frequency information from the trajectories. It then uses the first and second-order differences to mitigate non-stationarity, followed by pooling for future predictions. Through capturing varying frequency characteristics and alleviate the linear and quadric trend in the raw physical dynamics, NS-EGNN better models the temporal dependencies in the physical dynamics. NS-EGNN has been applied on various types of physical dynamics, including molecular, motion and protein dynamics. In various scenario, NS-EGNN consistently surpasses the performance of existing state-of-the-art algorithms, underscoring its effectiveness. The implementation of NS-EGNN is available at https://github.com/MaojiWEN/NS-EGNN.",

The efficacy of such predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic) uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.",

Identifying key brain regional activities and functional connectivity patterns is essential for discovering more precise neurobiological biomarkers. However, previous studies have primarily emphasized alterations in functional connectivity while overlooking abnormal neuronal population activity within brain regions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Local-Global Coupling Spiking Graph Transformer (LGC-SGT) that jointly models both inter-regional connectivity differences and deviations in neuronal population firing rates within brain regions, enabling a dual-perspective neuropathological analysis. The global pathway leverages spike-based computation in LGC-SGT to model biologically plausible aberrant neural firing dynamics, while the local pathway adaptively captures abnormal graph-based representations of brain connectivity learned by local plasticity in the liquid state machine module.  Furthermore, we design a shortcut-enhanced output strategy in LGC-SGT with the hybrid loss function to suppress outlier interference caused by inter-individual and inter-center variability, enabling a more robust decision boundary. Extensive experiments on three brain disorder datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph methods in brain disorder diagnosis. Moreover, it facilitates the extraction of interpretable neurobiological biomarkers by jointly analyzing regional neural activity and functional connectivity, offering a more comprehensive framework for brain disorder understanding and diagnosis.",

Our approach upgrades diffusion models---whether trained for static structure prediction or conformational generation---to enable more efficient discovery of conformational variability without requiring prior knowledge of major degrees of freedom. ConforMix is orthogonal to improvements in model pretraining and would benefit even a hypothetical model that perfectly reproduced the Boltzmann distribution. Remarkably, when applied to a diffusion model trained for static structure prediction, ConforMix captures structural changes including domain motion, cryptic pocket flexibility, and transporter cycling, while avoiding unphysical states.

Two types of labelling noises are prevalent: objects that are incorrectly classified (categorization noise) and inaccurate bounding boxes (localization noise); both noises typically occur together in large-scale datasets. In this paper we propose a distillation-based method to train object detectors that takes into account both categorization and localization noise. The key insight underpinning our method is that the early-learning phenomenon - in which models trained on noisy data with mixed clean and false labels tend to first fit to the clean data, and memorize the false labels later -- manifests earlier for localization noise than for categorization noise. We propose a method that uses models from the early-learning phase (before overfitting to noisy data occurs) as a teacher network. A plug-in module implementation compatible with general object detection architectures is developed, and its performance is validated against the state-of-the-art using PASCAL VOC, MS COCO and VinDr-CXR medical detection datasets.",

We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all‐atom protein structures, including every side‐chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low‐dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue‐based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral‐angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a $2\\mu\\text{s}$ MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D$2$ receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategies reproduce the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all‐atom lDDT \\~ $0.7$; $C\\alpha$-lDDT \\~ $0.8$) and recovers backbone and side‐chain dihedral‐angle distributions with a Jensen–Shannon divergence $<0.03$ compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system‐specific, all‐atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure‐based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets.

A fundamental challenge in ST analysis is clustering spatial spots into coherent functional regions. While existing models effectively integrate expression and spatial signals, they largely overlook sequence-level biological priors encoded in the DNA sequences of expressed genes. To bridge this gap, we propose SAINT (Sequence-Aware Integration for Nucleotide-informed Transcriptomics), a unified framework that augments spatial representation learning with nucleotide-derived features. We construct sequence-augmented datasets across 14 tissue sections from three widely used ST benchmarks (DLPFC, HBC, and MBA), retrieving reference DNA sequences for each expressed gene and encoding them using a pretrained Nucleotide Transformer. For each spot, gene-level embeddings are aggregated via expression-weighted and attention-based pooling, then fused with spatial-expression representations through a late fusion module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAINT consistently improves clustering performance across multiple datasets. Experiments validate the superiority, effectiveness, sensitivity, and transferability of our framework, confirming the complementary value of incorporating sequence-level priors into spatial transcriptomics clustering.",

Recent advances in EEG-based neural decoding have shown promise, yet two critical limitations remain in this area: poor generalization across subjects and constraints to specific visual tasks. We introduce NEED, the first unified framework achieving zero-shot cross-subject and cross-task generalization for EEG-based visual reconstruction. Our approach addresses three fundamental challenges: (1) cross-subject variability through an Individual Adaptation Module pretrained on multiple EEG datasets to normalize subject-specific patterns, (2) limited spatial resolution and complex temporal dynamics via a dual-pathway architecture capturing both low-level visual dynamics and high-level semantics, and (3) task specificity constraints through a unified inference mechanism adaptable to different visual domains. For video reconstruction, NEED achieves better performance than existing methods. Importantly, Our model maintains 93.7% of within-subject classification performance and 92.4% of visual reconstruction quality when generalizing to unseen subjects, while achieving an SSIM of 0.352 when transferring directly to static image reconstruction without fine-tuning, demonstrating how neural decoding can move beyond subject and task boundaries toward truly generalizable brain-computer interfaces.",

Building on prior work, we develop a game-theoretic model that captures how the agent’s participation and reporting behavior respond to the principal’s statistical decision rule. Despite the complexity of the interaction, we show that the principal's errors exhibit clear monotonic behavior when segmented by an efficiently computable critical p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable characterization of their optimal p-value threshold.

While personalized decision systems are often modeled using bandit formulations, the integration of GenAI introduces new structure into otherwise classical sequential learning problems. In GenAI-powered interventions, the agent selects a query, but the environment experiences a stochastic response drawn from the generative model. Standard bandit methods do not explicitly account for this structure, where actions influence rewards only through stochastic, observed treatments. We introduce generator-mediated bandit-Thompson sampling (GAMBITTS), a bandit approach designed for this action/treatment split, using mobile health interventions with large language model-generated text as a motivating case study. GAMBITTS explicitly models both the treatment and reward generation processes, using information in the delivered treatment to accelerate policy learning relative to standard methods. We establish regret bounds for GAMBITTS by decomposing sources of uncertainty in treatment and reward, identifying conditions where it achieves stronger guarantees than standard bandit approaches. In simulation studies, GAMBITTS consistently outperforms conventional algorithms by leveraging observed treatments to more accurately estimate expected rewards.",

To address these limitations, we introduce a streamlined $\\textit{KS metric-based post-processing}$ framework (KSP) that calibrates survival predictions without relying on discretization or KM estimation. This design enhances flexibility and broad applicability. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets using a variety of survival models.

    "abstract": "Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple linguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are highly \"entangled,\" mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and reasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward linguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult to isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we introduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these components. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our method iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically, reasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG) brain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We show that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive power, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other linguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions beyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is temporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to lexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing hierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as their predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow features, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing. Our work provides compelling neural evidence for an abstract reasoning computation during language comprehension and offers a robust framework for mapping distinct cognitive functions from artificial models to the human brain.",

A key limitation of these models is their inability to readily integrate available partial observations and additional priors. In contrast, energy-based models (EBMs) address this by incorporating corresponding scalar energy terms. Here, we propose Energy Matching, a framework that endows flow-based approaches with the flexibility of EBMs. Far from the data manifold, samples move from noise to data along irrotational, optimal transport paths. As they approach the data manifold, an entropic energy term guides the system into a Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, explicitly capturing the underlying likelihood structure of the data. We parameterize these dynamics with a single time-independent scalar field, which serves as both a powerful generator and a flexible prior for effective regularization of inverse problems. The present method substantially outperforms existing EBMs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet generation in terms of fidelity, while retaining simulation-free training of transport-based approaches away from the data manifold. Furthermore, we leverage the flexibility of the method to introduce an interaction energy that supports the exploration of diverse modes, which we demonstrate in a controlled protein generation setting. This approach learns a scalar potential energy, without time conditioning, auxiliary generators, or additional networks, marking a significant departure from recent EBM methods. We believe this simplified yet rigorous formulation significantly advances EBMs capabilities and paves the way for their wider adoption in generative modeling in diverse domains.",

While recent efforts incorporate codon-level inductive biases through auxiliary objectives, they often fall short of explicitly modeling the structured relationships that arise from the genetic code’s inherent symmetries. We introduce Equi‑mRNA, the first codon‑level equivariant mRNA language model that explicitly encodes synonymous codon symmetries as cyclic subgroups of 2D Special Orthogonal matrix ($\\mathrm{SO}(2)$). By combining group‑theoretic priors with an auxiliary equivariance loss and symmetry‑aware pooling, Equi‑mRNA learns biologically grounded representations that outperform vanilla baselines across multiple axes. On downstream property‑prediction tasks including expression, stability, and riboswitch switching Equi‑mRNA delivers up to $\\approx$ 10\\% improvements in accuracy. In sequence generation, it produces mRNA constructs that are up to $\\approx$ 4$\\times$ more realistic under Fréchet BioDistance metrics and $\\approx$ 28\\% better preserve functional properties compared to vanilla baseline. Interpretability analyses further reveal that learned codon‑rotation distributions recapitulate known GC‑content biases and tRNA abundance patterns, offering novel insights into codon usage. Equi‑mRNA establishes a new biologically principled paradigm for mRNA modeling, with significant implications for the design of next‑generation therapeutics.",

Two main strategies have emerged for learning invariant distributions: designing equivariant network architectures and using data augmentation to approximate equivariance. While equivariant architectures preserve symmetry by design, they often involve greater complexity and pose optimization challenges. Data augmentation, on the other hand, offers flexibility but may fall short in fully capturing symmetries. Our framework enhances both approaches by reducing training variance and providing a provably lower-variance gradient estimator. We achieve this by interpreting data augmentation as a Monte Carlo estimator of the training gradient and applying Rao–Blackwellization. This leads to more stable optimization, faster convergence, and reduced variance, all while requiring only a single forward and backward pass per sample. We also present a practical implementation of this estimator—incorporating the loss and sampling procedure—through a method we call Orbit Diffusion. Theoretically, we guarantee that our loss admits equivariant minimizers. Empirically, Orbit Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art results on GEOM-QM9 for molecular conformation generation, improves crystal structure prediction, and advances text-guided crystal generation on the Perov-5 and MP-20 benchmarks. Additionally, it enhances protein designability in protein structure generation. Code is available at https://github.com/vinhsuhi/Orbit-Diffusion.git.",

Despite advancements in Bridge and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce Momentum Multi-Marginal Schrödinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM), a novel matching framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies, opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal settings.",

Functional connectivity matrices lie in constrained spaces—such as the set of symmetric positive definite or correlation matrices—that can be modeled as Riemannian manifolds. However, using Riemannian tools typically requires redefining core operations (geodesics, norms, integration), making generative modeling computationally inefficient. In this work, we propose DiffeoCFM, an approach that enables conditional flow matching (CFM) on matrix manifolds by exploiting pullback metrics induced by global diffeomorphisms on Euclidean spaces. We show that Riemannian CFM with such metrics is equivalent to applying standard CFM after data transformation. This equivalence allows efficient vector field learning, and fast sampling with standard ODE solvers. We instantiate DiffeoCFM with two different settings: the matrix logarithm for covariance matrices and the normalized Cholesky decomposition for correlation matrices. We evaluate DiffeoCFM on three large-scale fMRI datasets with more than $4600$ scans from $2800$ subjects (ADNI, ABIDE, OASIS‑3) and two EEG motor imagery datasets with over $30000$ trials from $26$ subjects (BNCI2014‑002 and BNCI2015‑001). It enables fast training and achieves state-of-the-art performance, all while preserving manifold constraints.\nCode: https://github.com/antoinecollas/DiffeoCFM",

To address this issue, we propose a Topology-Aware diffusion-based Graph Generation (TAGG), which aims to sample synthetic graphs that closely resemble the structural characteristics of the original graph based on persistent homology. Specifically, we suggest two core components: 1) Persistence Diagram Matching (PDM) loss which ensures high topological fidelity of generated graphs, and 2) topology-aware attention module (TAM) which induces the denoising network to capture the homological characteristics of the original graphs. Extensive experiments on conventional graph benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach demonstrating high generation performance across various metrics, while achieving closer alignment with the distribution of topological features observed in the original graphs.

Existing methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data.

Recent advances in deep generative models have enabled function-based protein design from textual descriptions, yet struggle with structural plausibility. Inspired by classical protein design methods that leverage natural protein structures, we explore whether incorporating fragments from natural proteins can enhance foldability in generative models. Our empirical results show that even random incorporation of fragments improves foldability. Building on this insight, we introduce ProDVa, a novel protein design approach that integrates a text encoder for functional descriptions, a protein language model for designing proteins, and a fragment encoder to dynamically retrieve protein fragments based on textual functional descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively designs protein sequences that are both functionally aligned and structurally plausible. Compared to state-of-the-art models, ProDVa achieves comparable function alignment using less than 0.04% of the training data, while designing significantly more well-folded proteins, with the proportion of proteins having pLDDT above 70 increasing by 7.38% and those with PAE below 10 increasing by 9.62%.",
