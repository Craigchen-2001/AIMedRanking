While existing models have demonstrated competitive performance in generating ligand molecules, they primarily focus on learning the chemical distribution of training datasets, often lacking effective steerability to ensure the desired chemical quality of generated molecules. To address this issue, we propose a multi-reward optimization framework that fine-tunes generative models for attributes, such as binding affinity, validity, and drug-likeness, together. Specifically, we derive direct preference optimization for a Bayesian flow network, used as a backbone for molecule generation, and integrate a reward normalization scheme to adopt multiple objectives. Experimental results show that our method generates more realistic ligands than baseline models while achieving higher binding affinity, expanding the Pareto front empirically observed in previous studies.",

The incorporation of mechanistic models also provides inductive bias in standard blackbox modeling approaches, critical when learning from small datasets or partially observed, complex systems. Unfortunately, as the hybrid models become more flexible, the causal grounding provided by the mechanistic model can quickly be lost. We address this problem by leveraging another common source of domain knowledge: *ranking* of treatment effects for a set of interventions, even if the precise treatment effect is unknown. We encode this information in a *causal loss* that we combine with the standard predictive loss to arrive at a *hybrid loss* that biases our learning towards causally valid hybrid models. We demonstrate our ability to achieve a win-win, state-of-the-art predictive performance *and* causal validity, in the challenging task of modeling glucose dynamics post-exercise in individuals with type 1 diabetes.",

To be robust to outliers and differences in scale across features, a matrix factorization step is usually preceded by ad-hoc feature normalization steps, such as tf-idf scaling or data whitening. We propose in this work to learn these normalization operators jointly with the factorization itself. More precisely, given a $d\\times n$ matrix $X$ of $d$ features measured on $n$ individuals, we propose to learn the parameters of quantile normalization operators that can operate row-wise on the values of $X$ and/or of its factorization $UV$ to improve the quality of the low-rank representation of $X$ itself. This optimization is facilitated by the introduction of a new differentiable quantile normalization operator built using optimal transport, providing new results on top of existing work by Cuturi et al. (2019). We demonstrate the applicability of these techniques on synthetic and genomics datasets.",

ERM systems can also proactively reposition responders between predesignated waiting locations to cover any gaps that arise due to the prior dispatch of responders or significant changes in the distribution of anticipated requests. Optimal repositioning is computationally challenging due to the exponential number of ways to allocate responders between locations and the uncertainty in future requests. The state-of-the-art approach in proactive repositioning is a hierarchical approach based on spatial decomposition and online Monte Carlo tree search, which may require minutes of computation for each decision in a domain where seconds can save lives. We address the issue of long decision times by introducing a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach, based on the same hierarchical decomposition, but replacing online search with learning. To address the computational challenges posed by large, variable-dimensional, and discrete state and action spaces, we propose: (1) actor-critic based agents that incorporate transformers to handle variable-dimensional states and actions, (2) projections to fixed-dimensional observations to handle complex states, and (3) combinatorial techniques to map continuous actions to discrete allocations. We evaluate our approach using real-world data from two U.S. cities, Nashville, TN and Seattle, WA. Our experiments show that compared to the state of the art, our approach reduces computation time per decision by three orders of magnitude, while also slightly reducing average ambulance response time by 5 seconds.",

    "abstract": "High-dimensional imaging of neural activity, such as widefield calcium and functional ultrasound imaging, provide a rich source of information for understanding the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Accurately modeling neural dynamics in these modalities is crucial for understanding this relationship but is hindered by the high-dimensionality, complex spatiotemporal dependencies, and prevalent behaviorally irrelevant dynamics in these modalities. Existing dynamical models often employ preprocessing steps to obtain low-dimensional representations from neural image modalities. However, this process can discard behaviorally relevant information and miss spatiotemporal structure. We propose SBIND, a novel data-driven deep learning framework to model spatiotemporal dependencies in neural images and disentangle their behaviorally relevant dynamics from other neural dynamics. We validate SBIND on widefield imaging datasets, and show its extension to functional ultrasound imaging, a recent modality whose dynamical modeling has largely remained unexplored. We find that our model effectively identifies both local and long-range spatial dependencies across the brain while also dissociating behaviorally relevant neural dynamics. Doing so, SBIND outperforms existing models in neural-behavioral prediction. Overall, SBIND provides a versatile tool for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying behavior using imaging modalities.",

Assuming a budget on the number of labels that can be collected, the methodology uses a machine learning model to identify which data points would be most beneficial to label, thus effectively utilizing the budget. It operates on a simple yet powerful intuition: prioritize the collection of labels for data points where the model exhibits uncertainty, and rely on the model's predictions where it is confident. Active inference constructs valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests while leveraging any black-box machine learning model and handling any data distribution. The key point is that it achieves the same level of accuracy with far fewer samples than existing baselines relying on non-adaptively-collected data. This means that for the same number of collected samples, active inference enables smaller confidence intervals and more powerful tests.

However, interpreting and quantifying agents' contributions to such relationships pose significant challenges. These challenges are particularly prominent in the context of multi-agent sequential decision-making, where the causal effect of an agent's action on the outcome depends on how other agents respond to that action. In this paper, our objective is to present a systematic approach for attributing the causal effects of agents' actions to the influence they exert on other agents. Focusing on multi-agent Markov decision processes, we introduce agent-specific effects (ASE), a novel causal quantity that measures the effect of an agent's action on the outcome that propagates through other agents. We then turn to the counterfactual counterpart of ASE (cf-ASE), provide a sufficient set of conditions for identifying cf-ASE, and propose a practical sampling-based algorithm for estimating it. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the utility of cf-ASE through a simulation-based testbed, which includes a sepsis management environment.",

Graph neural networks stand to benefit from clever matching to understand the structural alignment of retrieved molecules to a query molecule. Neural graph matching offers a compelling solution by explicitly modeling node and edge affinities between two structural graphs while employing a noise-robust, end-to-end neural network to learn affinity metrics. We apply this approach to mass spectrum simulation and introduce MARASON, a novel model that incorporates neural graph matching to enhance a fragmentation-based neural network. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our design, with MARASON achieving 27% top-1 accuracy, a substantial improvement over the non-retrieval state-of-the-art accuracy of 19%.

We propose Wasserstein flow matching (WFM), which lifts flow matching onto families of distributions using  the Wasserstein geometry. Notably, WFM is the first algorithm capable of generating distributions in high dimensions, whether represented analytically (as Gaussians) or empirically (as point-clouds). Our theoretical analysis establishes that Wasserstein geodesics constitute proper conditional flows over the space of distributions, making for a valid FM objective. Our algorithm leverages optimal transport theory and the attention mechanism, demonstrating versatility across computational regimes: exploiting closed-form optimal transport paths for Gaussian families, while using entropic estimates on point-clouds for general distributions. WFM successfully generates both 2D \\& 3D shapes and high-dimensional cellular microenvironments from spatial transcriptomics data.

To address these challenges, we propose a randomization inference framework that ensures finite-sample exact and model-free type I error rate control, adhering to the \u201canalyze as you randomize\u201d principle to safeguard against hidden biases. Recognizing that biased external controls reduce the power of randomization tests, we leverage conformal inference to develop an individualized test-then-pool procedure that selectively borrows comparable external controls to improve power. Our approach incorporates selection uncertainty into randomization tests, providing valid post-selection inference. Additionally, we propose an adaptive procedure to optimize the selection threshold by minimizing the mean squared error across a class of estimators encompassing both no-borrowing and full-borrowing approaches. The proposed methods are supported by non-asymptotic theoretical analysis, validated through simulations, and applied to a randomized lung cancer trial that integrates external controls from the National Cancer Database.",

We define personalized interpretability as a measure of sample-specific feature attribution, and view it as a minimum requirement for a precision health model to justify its conclusions. Some health data, especially those generated by high-throughput sequencing experiments, have nuances that compromise precision health models and their interpretation. These data are compositional, meaning that each feature is conditionally dependent on all other features. We propose the Deep Compositional Data Analysis (DeepCoDA) framework to extend precision health modelling to high-dimensional compositional data, and to provide personalized interpretability through patient-specific weights.

In the domain of 2D images, many availability attacks have been proposed to prevent data from being illicitly learned by unauthorized deep models. However, unlike images represented on a fixed dimensional grid, point clouds are characterized as unordered and unstructured sets, posing a significant challenge in designing an effective availability attack for 3D deep learning. In this paper, we theoretically show that extending 2D availability attacks directly to 3D point clouds under distance regularization is susceptible to the degeneracy, rendering the generated poisons weaker or even ineffective. This is because in bi-level optimization, introducing regularization term can result in update directions out of control. To address this issue, we propose a novel Feature Collision Error-Minimization (FC-EM) method, which creates additional shortcuts in the feature space, inducing different update directions to prevent the degeneracy of bi-level optimization. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates the effectiveness of the FC-EM attack.

Here, we make first steps in this direction and examine the impact of test loss, training corpus and model architecture (comparing GloVe, LSTM, GPT-2 and BERT), on the prediction of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging time-courses of participants listening to an audiobook. We find that (1) untrained versions of each model already explain significant amount of signal in the brain by capturing similarity in brain responses across identical words, with the untrained LSTM outperforming the transformer-based models, being less impacted by the effect of context; (2) that training NLP models improves brain scores in the same brain regions irrespective of the model\u2019s architecture; (3) that Perplexity (test loss) is not a good predictor of brain score; (4) that training data have a strong influence on the outcome and, notably, that off-the-shelf models may lack statistical power to detect brain activations.

Recent flow-based generative models have achieved impressive results by gradually adding and then learning to remove noise from these graphs. Existing models, however, use graph neural network architectures that are independent of the noise level, limiting their expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce *Noise-Conditioned Graph Networks* (NCGNs), a class of graph neural networks that dynamically modify their architecture according to the noise level during generation. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that as noise increases, (1) graphs require information from increasingly distant neighbors and (2) graphs can be effectively represented at lower resolutions. Based on these insights, we develop Dynamic Message Passing (DMP), a specific instantiation of NCGNs that adapts both the range and resolution of message passing to the noise level. DMP consistently outperforms noise independent architectures on a variety of domains including $3$D point clouds, spatiotemporal transcriptomics, and images.",

Existing grouped clustering methods only consider the shared variables but ignore valuable information from the group-specific variables. To allow for these group-specific variables to aid in the clustering, we propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach, termed global-local (GLocal) Dirichlet process, that models the \"global-local\" structure of the observations across groups. We characterize the GLocal Dirichlet process using the stick-breaking representation and the representation as a limit of a finite mixture model. We theoretically quantify the approximation errors of the truncated prior, the corresponding finite mixture model, and the associated posterior distribution.

As an upstream task, researches have built generative models to synthesize ECG data, which are beneficial to providing training samples, privacy protection, and annotation reduction. However, previous generative methods for ECG often neither synthesized multi-view data, nor dealt with heart disease conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel disease-aware generative adversarial network for multi-view ECG synthesis called ME-GAN, which attains panoptic electrocardio representations conditioned on heart diseases and projects the representations onto multiple standard views to yield ECG signals. Since ECG manifestations of heart diseases are often localized in specific waveforms, we propose a new \"mixup normalization\" to inject disease information precisely into suitable locations. In addition, we propose a \"view discriminator\" to revert disordered ECG views into a pre-determined order, supervising the generator to obtain ECG representing correct view characteristics. Besides, a new metric, rFID, is presented to assess the quality of the synthesized ECG signals. Comprehensive experiments verify that our ME-GAN performs well on multi-view ECG signal synthesis with trusty morbid manifestations.",

Our encoder produces a multi-resolution representation for each molecule in a fine-to-coarse fashion, from atoms to connected motifs. Each level integrates the encoding of constituents below with the graph at that level. Our autoregressive coarse-to-fine decoder adds one motif at a time, interleaving the decision of selecting a new motif with the process of resolving its attachments to the emerging molecule.

However, current generative approaches exhibit a significant challenge: they do not ensure that the proposed molecular structures can be feasibly synthesized nor do they provide the synthesis routes of the proposed small molecules, thereby seriously limiting their practical applicability. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) setup for de novo drug design: Policy Gradient for Forward Synthesis (PGFS), that addresses this challenge by embedding the concept of synthetic accessibility directly into the de novo drug design system. In this setup, the agent learns to navigate through the immense synthetically accessible chemical space by subjecting initial commercially available molecules to valid chemical reactions at every time step of the iterative virtual synthesis process. The proposed environment for drug discovery provides a highly challenging test-bed for RL algorithms owing to the large state space and high-dimensional continuous action space with hierarchical actions. PGFS achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating structures with high QED and clogP. Moreover, we validate PGFS in an in-silico proof-of-concept associated with three HIV targets. Finally, we describe how the end-to-end training conceptualized in this study represents an important paradigm in radically expanding the synthesizable chemical space and automating the drug discovery process.",

Yet, finding the optimal data mixture is a challenging and open problem. We formalize this data mixing problem as a bi-level objective: the best mixture is the one that would lead to the best model for a downstream objective. Unfortunately, this objective is generally intractable. In this paper, we make the observation that the bi-level data mixing objective becomes convex as our model class becomes larger. We develop and study a gradient-based approach for optimizing this convex objective, which we call MixMin, and test it on language modeling and chemistry tasks. MixMin was the only method that uniformly improved the data mixture in all our experiments. With MixMin, we improved the data mixture using less than 0.2% additional compute for a pythia-$410M$ model trained on $8.2B$ tokens, resulting between 1-5% relative improvement to negative log likelihood on PIQA, ARC Easy, SciQ, and OpenWebMath. Crucially, we found that MixMin mixtures for smaller models improved training of larger models, suggesting that MixMin mixtures may be scale-invariant. When mixing bioassay data to train an XGBoost model, we saw improvements to average precision scores of $0.03-0.15$.",

Previous attempts led to mitigated performance in this high-dimension setting; we introduce a novel approach to time series forecasting by providing an alternative to conventional methods to deal with high number of potential features of interest (409 predictors). We integrate Reservoir Computing (RC) with feature selection using a genetic algorithm (GA) to gather optimal non-linear combinations of inputs to improve prediction in sample-efficient context. We illustrate that the RC-GA combination exhibits excellent performance in forecasting SARS-CoV-2 hospitalizations. This approach outperformed the use of RC alone and other conventional methods: LSTM, Transformers, Elastic-Net, XGBoost. Notably, this work marks the pioneering use of RC (along with GA) in the realm of short and high-dimensional time series, positioning it as a competitive and innovative approach in comparison to standard methods.",

The most accurate and efficient way to compute spherical convolutions is in the spectral domain (via the convolution theorem), which is still costlier than the usual planar convolutions. For this reason, applications of spherical CNNs have so far been limited to small problems that can be approached with low model capacity. In this work, we show how spherical CNNs can be scaled for much larger problems. To achieve this, we make critical improvements including novel variants of common model components, an implementation of core operations to exploit hardware accelerator characteristics, and application-specific input representations that exploit the properties of our model. Experiments show our larger spherical CNNs reach state-of-the-art on several targets of the QM9 molecular benchmark, which was previously dominated by equivariant graph neural networks, and achieve competitive performance on multiple weather forecasting tasks.

In this work, we propose a data-efficient property predictor by utilizing a learnable hierarchical molecular grammar that can generate molecules from grammar production rules. Such a grammar induces an explicit geometry of the space of molecular graphs, which provides an informative prior on molecular structural similarity. The property prediction is performed using graph neural diffusion over the grammar-induced geometry.

Various statistical methods have explored the latent communication across multiple brain regions. Two main categories are the Gaussian Process (GP) and Linear Dynamical System (LDS), each with unique strengths. The GP-based approach effectively discovers latent variables with frequency bands and communication directions. Conversely, the LDS-based approach is computationally efficient but lacks powerful expressiveness in latent representation. In this study, we merge both methodologies by creating an LDS mirroring a multi-output GP, termed Multi-Region Markovian Gaussian Process (MRM-GP). Our work establishes a connection between an LDS and a multi-output GP that explicitly models frequencies and phase delays within the latent space of neural recordings. Consequently, the model achieves a linear inference cost over time points and provides an interpretable low-dimensional representation, revealing communication directions across brain regions and separating oscillatory communications into different frequency bands.",

    "abstract": "Models trained on a labeled source domain often generalize poorly when deployed on an out-of-distribution (OOD) target domain. In the domain adaptation setting where unlabeled target data is available, self-supervised pretraining (e.g., contrastive learning or masked autoencoding) is a promising method to mitigate this performance drop. Pretraining depends on generic data augmentations (e.g., cropping or masking) to learn representations that generalize across domains, which may not work for all distribution shifts. In this paper, we show on real-world tasks that standard fine-tuning after pretraining does not consistently improve OOD error over simply training from scratch on labeled source data. To better leverage pretraining for distribution shifts, we propose the Connect Later framework, which fine-tunes the model with targeted augmentations designed with knowledge of the shift. Intuitively, pretraining learns good representations within the source and target domains, while fine-tuning with targeted augmentations improves generalization across domains. Connect Later achieves state-of-the-art OOD accuracy while maintaining comparable or better in-distribution accuracy on 4 real-world tasks in wildlife identification (iWildCam-WILDS), tumor detection (Camelyon17-WILDS), and astronomy (AstroClassification, Redshifts).",

    "abstract": "Cancer, a leading cause of death globally, occurs due to genomic changes and manifests heterogeneously across patients. To advance research on personalized treatment strategies, the effectiveness of various drugs on cells derived from cancers ('cell lines') is experimentally determined in laboratory settings. Nevertheless, variations in the distribution of genomic data and drug responses between cell lines and humans arise due to biological and environmental differences. Moreover, while genomic profiles of many cancer patients are readily available, the scarcity of corresponding drug response data limits the ability to train machine learning models that can predict drug response in patients effectively. Recent cancer drug response prediction methods have largely followed the paradigm of unsupervised domain-invariant representation learning followed by a downstream drug response classification step. Introducing supervision in both stages is challenging due to heterogeneous patient response to drugs and limited drug response data. This paper addresses these challenges through a novel representation learning method in the first phase and weak supervision in the second. Experimental results on real patient data demonstrate the efficacy of our method WISER (Weak supervISion and supErvised Representation learning) over state-of-the-art alternatives on predicting personalized drug response.

A key step toward this goal is estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE)\u2014the way treatments impact different subgroups. While crucial, HTE estimation is challenging with survival data, where time until an event (e.g., death) is key. Existing methods often assume complete observation, an assumption violated in survival data due to right-censoring, leading to bias and inefficiency. Cui et al. (2023) proposed a doubly-robust method for HTE estimation in survival data under no hidden confounders, combining a causal survival forest with an augmented inverse-censoring weighting estimator. However, we find it struggles under heavy censoring, which is common in rare-outcome problems such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, most current methods cannot handle instrumental variables, which are a crucial tool in the causal inference arsenal. We introduce Multiple Imputation for Survival Treatment Response (MISTR), a novel, general, and non-parametric method for estimating HTE in survival data. MISTR uses recursively imputed survival trees to handle censoring without directly modeling the censoring mechanism. Through extensive simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets\u2014the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 175 and the Illinois unemployment dataset we show that MISTR outperforms prior methods under heavy censoring in the no-hidden-confounders setting, and extends to the instrumental variable setting. To our knowledge, MISTR is the first non-parametric approach for HTE estimation with unobserved confounders via instrumental variables.",

Capitalizing on ideas from classical jackknife resampling, we develop a frequentist alternative that: (a) does not interfere with model training or compromise its accuracy, (b) applies to any RNN architecture, and (c) provides theoretical coverage guarantees on the estimated uncertainty intervals. Our method derives predictive uncertainty from the variability of the (jackknife) sampling distribution of the RNN outputs, which is estimated by repeatedly deleting \u201cblocks\u201d of (temporally-correlated) training data, and collecting the predictions of the RNN re-trained on the remaining data.

    "abstract": "*De novo* peptide sequencing is a fundamental computational technique for ascertaining amino acid sequences of peptides directly from tandem mass spectrometry data, eliminating the need for reference databases. Cutting-edge models encode the observed mass spectra into latent representations from which peptides are predicted auto-regressively. However, the issue of missing fragmentation, attributable to factors such as suboptimal fragmentation efficiency and instrumental constraints, presents a formidable challenge in practical applications. To tackle this obstacle, we propose a novel computational paradigm called $\\underline{\\textbf{L}}$atent $\\underline{\\textbf{I}}$mputation before $\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$rediction (LIPNovo). LIPNovo is devised to compensate for missing fragmentation information within observed spectra before executing the final peptide prediction. Rather than generating raw missing data, LIPNovo performs imputation in the latent space, guided by the theoretical peak profile of the target peptide sequence. The imputation process is conceptualized as a set-prediction problem, utilizing a set of learnable peak queries to reason about the relationships among observed peaks and directly generate the latent representations of theoretical peaks through optimal bipartite matching. In this way, LIPNovo manages to supplement missing information during inference and thus boosts performance. Despite its simplicity, experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that LIPNovo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Code is available at https://github.com/usr922/LIPNovo.",

We propose a weaker notion of *partial exchangeability*, better suited to the FL setting, and use it to develop the Federated Conformal Prediction (FCP) framework. We show FCP enjoys rigorous theoretical guarantees and excellent empirical performance on several computer vision and medical imaging datasets.

Yet, this is challenging due to the computational demands of equivariance and global context at scale. Standard methods such as equivariant self-attention suffer from quadratic complexity, while local methods such as distance-based message passing sacrifice global information. Inspired by the recent success of state-space and long-convolutional models, we introduce Geometric Hyena, the first equivariant long-convolutional model for geometric systems. Geometric Hyena captures global geometric context at sub-quadratic complexity while maintaining equivariance to rotations and translations. Evaluated on all-atom property prediction of large RNA molecules and full protein molecular dynamics, Geometric Hyena outperforms existing equivariant models while requiring significantly less memory and compute that equivariant self-attention. Notably, our model processes the geometric context of $30k$ tokens $20 \\times$ faster than the equivariant transformer and allows $72 \\times$ longer context within the same budget.",

Following an analysis of objectives from both fields, we propose Temporal Label Smoothing (TLS), a simpler, yet best-performing method that preserves prediction monotonicity over time. By focusing the objective on areas with a stronger predictive signal, TLS improves performance over all baselines on two large-scale benchmark tasks.

    "abstract": "Machine learning for protein modeling faces significant challenges due to proteins' inherently dynamic nature, yet most graph-based machine learning methods rely solely on static structural information. Recently, the growing availability of molecular dynamics trajectories provides new opportunities for understanding the dynamic behavior of proteins; however, computational methods for utilizing this dynamic information remain limited. We propose a novel graph representation that integrates both static structural information and dynamic correlations from molecular dynamics trajectories, enabling more comprehensive modeling of proteins. By applying relational graph neural networks (RGNNs) to process this heterogeneous representation, we demonstrate significant improvements over structure-based approaches across three distinct tasks: atomic adaptability prediction, binding site detection, and binding affinity prediction. Our results validate that combining static and dynamic information provides complementary signals for understanding protein-ligand interactions, offering new possibilities for drug design and structural biology applications.",

However, due to the multi-site data aggregation and individual differences, brain graph datasets exhibit widespread distribution shifts, which impair the model\u2019s generalization ability to the test set, thereby limiting the performance of existing methods. To address these issues, we propose a Causally Invariance-aware Augmentation for brain Graph Contrastive Learning, called CIA-GCL. This method first generates a brain graph by extracting node features based on the topological structure. Then, a learnable brain invariant subgraph is identified based on a causal decoupling approach to capture the maximum label-related invariant information with invariant learning. Around this invariant subgraph, we design a novel invariance-aware augmentation strategy to generate meaningful augmented samples for graph contrast learning. Finally, the extracted invariant subgraph is utilized for brain disease classification, effectively mitigating distribution shifts while also identifying critical local graph structures, enhancing the model\u2019s interpretability. Experiments on three real-world brain disease datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively generalizes to multi-site brain datasets, and provides certain interpretability.",

However, existing methods for similar problems often lack supports in theory, making it hard to understand the underlying principles and conditions beyond empirical successes. In this work, a low-rank Poisson tensor model with an expressive unknown nonlinear side information extractor is proposed for under-counted multi-aspect data. A joint low-rank tensor completion and neural network learning algorithm is designed to recover the model. Moreover, the UC-TC formulation is supported by theoretical analysis showing that the fully counted entries of the tensor and each entry's under-counting probability can be provably recovered from partial observations---under reasonable conditions. To our best knowledge, the result is the first to offer theoretical supports for under-counted multi-aspect data completion.

In so-called inverse protein folding, the objective is to find a sequence of amino acids that adopts a target protein structure. Many inverse folding methods struggle to predict sequences for complexes that contain non-protein components, and perform poorly with complexes that adopt multiple structural states. To address these challenges, we present ADFLIP (All-atom Discrete FLow matching Inverse Protein folding), a generative model based on discrete flow-matching for designing protein sequences conditioned on all-atom structural contexts. ADFLIP progressively incorporates predicted amino acid side chains as structural context during sequence generation and enables the design of dynamic protein complexes through ensemble sampling across multiple structural states. Furthermore, ADFLIP implements training-free classifier guidance sampling, which allows the incorporation of arbitrary pre-trained models to optimise the designed sequence for desired protein properties. We evaluated the performance of ADFLIP on protein complexes with small-molecule ligands, nucleotides, or metal ions, including dynamic complexes for which structure ensembles were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-structure and multi-structure inverse folding tasks, demonstrating excellent potential for all-atom protein design.

Diffusion generative models have achieved considerable success in many applications. Score-based generative stochastic differential equations (SDE) model is a continuous-time diffusion model framework that enjoys many benefits, but the originally proposed SDEs are not naturally designed for modeling discrete data. To develop generative SDE models for discrete data such as biological sequences, here we introduce a diffusion process defined in the probability simplex space with stationary distribution being the Dirichlet distribution. This makes diffusion in continuous space natural for modeling discrete data. We refer to this approach as Dirchlet diffusion score model. We demonstrate that this technique can generate samples that satisfy hard constraints using a Sudoku generation task. This generative model can also solve Sudoku, including hard puzzles, without additional training. Finally, we applied this approach to develop the first human promoter DNA sequence design model and showed that designed sequences share similar properties with natural promoter sequences.",

    "abstract": "Interpretable policy learning seeks to estimate intelligible decision policies from observed actions; however, existing models force a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability, limiting data-driven interpretations of human decision-making processes. Fundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because they represent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact human decisions are dynamic and can change drastically under different contexts. Thus, we develop Contextualized Policy Recovery (CPR), which re-frames the problem of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task learning problem, where each context poses a unique task and complex decision policies can be constructed piece-wise from many simple context-specific policies. CPR models each context-specific policy as a linear map, and generates new policy models _on-demand_ as contexts are updated with new observations. We provide two flavors of the CPR framework: one focusing on exact local interpretability, and one retaining full global interpretability. We assess CPR through studies on simulated and real data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on predicting antibiotic prescription in intensive care units ($+22$% AUROC vs. previous SOTA) and predicting MRI prescription for Alzheimer's patients ($+7.7$% AUROC vs. previous SOTA). With this improvement, CPR closes the accuracy gap between interpretable and black-box methods, allowing high-resolution exploration and analysis of context-specific decision models.",

In this paper, we propose the use of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) tailored to leverage auxiliary structural information about contig relations when learning contig representations for subsequent metagenomic binning. Our method, CCVAE, improves on previous work that used VAEs for learning latent representations of the individual contigs, by constraining these representations according to the connectivity information from the assembly graph. Additionally, we incorporate into the model additional information in the form of marker genes to better differentiate contigs from different genomes. Our experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that CCVAE outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, thus providing a more effective method for metagenomic binning.",

A DMFB, composed of a two-dimensional electrode array, manipulates discrete fluid droplets to automatically execute biochemical protocols such as point-of-care clinical diagnosis. However, a major concern associated with the use of DMFBs is that electrodes in a biochip can degrade over time. Droplet-transportation operations associated with the degraded electrodes can fail, thereby compromising the integrity of the bioassay outcome. We show that casting droplet transportation as an RL problem enables the training of deep network policies to capture the underlying health conditions of electrodes and to provide reliable fluidic operations. We propose a new RL-based droplet-routing flow that can be used for various sizes of DMFBs, and demonstrate reliable execution of an epigenetic bioassay with the RL droplet router on a fabricated DMFB.

This can be because our visual system is not like a camera that ''remembers'' every pixel. Instead, only part of the information can be perceived with our selective attention, and the brain ''guesses'' the rest to form what we think we see. Most existing approaches ignored the brain completion mechanism. In this work, we propose to reconstruct seen images with both the visual perception and the brain completion process, and design a simple, yet effective visual decoding framework to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first construct a shared discrete representation space for both brain signals and images. Then, a novel self-supervised token-to-token inpainting network is designed to implement visual content completion by building context and prior knowledge about the visual objects from the discrete latent space. Our approach improved the quality of visual reconstruction significantly and achieved state-of-the-art.",

Here we address the use of deep-learning networks as inverse problem solvers, which has generated much excitement and even adoption efforts by the main equipment vendors for medical imaging including computed tomography (CT) and MRI. However, the recent demonstration that such networks suffer from a similar vulnerability to adversarial attacks potentially undermines their future. We propose to modify the training strategy of end-to-end deep-learning-based inverse problem solvers to improve robustness. To this end, we introduce an auxiliary net-work to generate adversarial examples, which is used in a min-max formulation to build robust image reconstruction networks. Theoretically, we argue that for such inverse problem solvers, one should analyze and study the effect of adversaries in the measurement-space, instead of in the signal-space used in previous work. We show for a linear reconstruction scheme that our min-max formulation results in a singular-value filter regularized solution, which suppresses the effect of adversarial examples. Numerical experiments using the proposed min-max scheme confirm convergence to this solution. We complement the theory by experiments on non-linear Compressive Sensing(CS) reconstruction by a deep neural network on two standard datasets, and, using anonymized clinical data, on a state-of-the-art published algorithm for low-dose x-ray CT reconstruction. We show a significant improvement in robustness over other methods for deep network-based reconstruction, by using the proposed approach.",

Online sampling routines are currently restricted to variations of reservoir sampling, where each sample is selected uniformly and independently of other samples. This renders them unsuitable for large-scale applications in computational biology, such as metagenomic community profiling and protein function annotation, which suffer from severe class imbalance. To maintain a representative and diverse sample, we must identify and preferentially select data that are likely to belong to rare classes. We argue that existing schemes for diversity sampling have prohibitive overhead for large-scale problems and high-throughput streams. We propose an efficient sampling routine that uses an online representation of the data distribution as a prefilter to retain elements from rare groups. We apply this method to several genomic data analysis tasks and demonstrate significant speedup in downstream analysis without sacrificing the quality of the results. Because our algorithm is 2x faster and uses 1000x less memory than coreset, reservoir and sketch-based alternatives, we anticipate that it will become a useful preprocessing step for applications with large-scale streaming data.",

These rationales are identified from molecules as substructures that are likely responsible for each property of interest. We then learn to expand rationales into a full molecule using graph generative models. Our final generative model composes molecules as mixtures of multiple rationale completions, and this mixture is fine-tuned to preserve the properties of interest.

How can these decisions be made such that the resulting designs are successful? This paper proposes a method for *design algorithm selection*, which aims to select design algorithms that will produce a distribution of design labels satisfying a user-specified success criterion\u2014for example, that at least ten percent of designs\u2019 labels exceed a threshold. It does so by combining designs\u2019 predicted property values with held-out labeled data to reliably forecast characteristics of the label distributions produced by different design algorithms, building upon techniques from prediction-powered inference (Angelopoulos et al., 2023). The method is guaranteed with high probability to return design algorithms that yield successful label distributions (or the null set if none exist), if the density ratios between the design and labeled data distributions are known.

A representation is identifiable if both the latent model and the transformation from latent to observed variables are unique. In this paper, we study observed variables that are a linear transformation of a linear latent causal model. Data from interventions are necessary for identifiability: if one latent variable is missing an intervention, we show that there exist distinct models that cannot be distinguished. Conversely, we show that a single intervention on each latent variable is sufficient for identifiability. Our proof uses a generalization of the RQ decomposition of a matrix that replaces the usual orthogonal and upper triangular conditions with analogues depending on a partial order on the rows of the matrix, with partial order determined by a latent causal model. We corroborate our theoretical results with a method for causal disentanglement.

One way to mitigate this burden is via active learning (AL) which involves the (a) acquisition and (b) annotation of informative unlabelled instances. Whereas previous work addresses either one of these elements independently, we propose an AL framework that addresses both. For acquisition, we propose Bayesian Active Learning by Consistency (BALC), a sub-framework which perturbs both instances and network parameters and quantifies changes in the network output probability distribution. For annotation, we propose SoQal, a sub-framework that dynamically determines whether, for each acquired unlabelled instance, to request a label from an oracle or to pseudo-label it instead. We show that BALC can outperform start-of-the-art acquisition functions such as BALD, and SoQal outperforms baseline methods even in the presence of a noisy oracle.",

This learning process is often costly for graph property learners like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). To address this, we propose a paradigm called Graph Nonparametric Teaching (GraNT) that reinterprets the learning process through a novel nonparametric teaching perspective. Specifically, the latter offers a theoretical framework for teaching implicitly defined (*i.e.*, nonparametric) mappings via example selection. Such an implicit mapping is realized by a dense set of graph-property pairs, with the GraNT teacher selecting a subset of them to promote faster convergence in GCN training. By analytically examining the impact of graph structure on parameter-based gradient descent during training, and recasting the evolution of GCNs\u2014shaped by parameter updates\u2014through functional gradient descent in nonparametric teaching, we show *for the first time* that teaching graph property learners (*i.e.*, GCNs) is consistent with teaching structure-aware nonparametric learners. These new findings readily commit GraNT to enhancing learning efficiency of the graph property learner, showing significant reductions in training time for graph-level regression (-36.62\\%), graph-level classification (-38.19\\%), node-level regression (-30.97\\%) and node-level classification (-47.30\\%), all while maintaining its generalization performance.",

Non-Autoregressive Transformers (NATs) have proven highly effective for this task, outperforming traditional methods. Unlike autoregressive models, which generate tokens sequentially, NATs predict all positions simultaneously, leveraging bidirectional context through unmasked self-attention.\nHowever, existing NAT approaches often rely on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, which presents significant optimization challenges due to CTC's complexity and increases the risk of training failures. To address these issues, we propose an improved non-autoregressive peptide sequencing model that incorporates a structured protein sequence curriculum learning strategy. This approach adjusts protein's learning difficulty based on the model\u2019s estimated protein generational capabilities through a sampling process, progressively learning peptide generation from simple to complex sequences. \nAdditionally, we introduce a self-refining inference-time module that iteratively enhances predictions using learned NAT token embeddings, improving sequence accuracy at a fine-grained level. Our curriculum learning strategy reduces NAT training failures frequency by more than 90% based on sampled training over various data distributions. Evaluations on nine benchmark species demonstrate that our approach outperforms all previous methods across multiple metrics and species.

The TKT leverages prior knowledge of the medical anatomy of fetal as topological information, reconstructing and aligning anatomy features across source and target domains. Then, the MKT formulates a more consistent and independent morphological representation for each substructure of an organ.

Current large-scale approaches, however, focus exclusively on either predicting neural activity from behavior (encoding) or predicting behavior from neural activity (decoding), limiting their ability to capture the bidirectional relationship between neural activity and behavior. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multimodal, multi-task model that enables simultaneous Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale (NEDS). Central to our approach is a novel multi-task-masking strategy, which alternates between neural, behavioral, within-modality, and cross-modality masking. We pretrain our method on the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) repeated site dataset, which includes recordings from 83 animals performing the visual decision-making task. In comparison to other large-scale modeling approaches, we demonstrate that NEDS achieves state-of-the-art performance for both encoding and decoding when pretrained on multi-animal data and then fine-tuned on new animals. Surprisingly, NEDS's learned embeddings exhibit emergent properties: even without explicit training, they are highly predictive of the brain regions in each recording. Altogether, our approach is a step towards a foundation model of the brain that enables seamless translation between neural activity and behavior.",

A major factor rendering MR inaccessible is lengthy scan times. An MR scanner collects measurements associated with the underlying anatomy in the Fourier space, also known as the k-space. Creating a high-fidelity image requires collecting large quantities of such measurements, increasing the scan time. Traditionally to accelerate an MR scan, image reconstruction from under-sampled k-space data is the method of choice. However, recent works show the feasibility of bypassing image reconstruction and directly learning to detect disease directly from a sparser learned subset of the k-space measurements. In this work, we propose Adaptive Sampling for MR (ASMR), a sampling method that learns an adaptive policy to sequentially select k-space samples to optimize for target disease detection. On 6 out of 8 pathology classification tasks spanning the Knee, Brain, and Prostate MR scans, ASMR reaches within 2% of the performance of a fully sampled classifier while using only 8% of the k-space, as well as outperforming prior state-of-the-art work in k-space sampling such as EMRT, LOUPE, and DPS.",

Here we propose MorphVAE, a sequence-to-sequence variational autoencoder with spherical latent space as a generative model for neural morphologies. The model operates on walks within the tree structure of a neuron and can incorporate expert annotations on a subset of the data using semi-supervised learning. We develop our model on artificially generated toy data and evaluate its performance on dendrites of excitatory cells and axons of inhibitory cells of mouse motor cortex (M1) and dendrites of retinal ganglion cells. We show that the learned latent feature space allows for better cell type discrimination than other commonly used features. By sampling new walks from the latent space we can easily construct new morphologies with a specified degree of similarity to their reference neuron, providing an efficient generative model for neural morphologies.",

Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic, state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable insights into neural dynamics.",

Concretely within the proposed SUICA, we incorporate a graph-augmented Autoencoder to effectively model the context information of the unstructured spots and provide informative embeddings that are structure-aware for spatial mapping. We also tackle the extremely skewed distribution in a regression-by-classification fashion and enforce classification-based loss functions for the optimization of SUICA. By extensive experiments of a wide range of common ST platforms under varying degradations, SUICA outperforms both conventional INR variants and SOTA methods regarding numerical fidelity, statistical correlation, and bio-conservation. The prediction by SUICA also showcases amplified gene signatures that enriches the bio-conservation of the raw data and benefits subsequent analysis.",

Many standard sequence analysis methods preprocess data using a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithm, one of the most widely used computational methods in all of science. However, as we show in this article, training generative probabilistic models with MSA preprocessing leads to statistical pathologies in the context of sequence prediction and forecasting. To address these problems, we propose a principled drop-in alternative to MSA preprocessing in the form of a structured observation distribution (the \"MuE\" distribution). We prove theoretically that the MuE distribution comprehensively generalizes popular methods for inferring biological sequence alignments, and provide a precise characterization of how such biological models have differed from natural language latent alignment models. We show empirically that models that use the MuE as an observation distribution outperform comparable methods across a variety of datasets, and apply MuE models to a novel problem for generative probabilistic sequence models: forecasting pathogen evolution.",

The most common training objective for these methods is wildtype accuracy: given a sequence or structure where a wildtype residue has been masked, predict the missing amino acid. Wildtype accuracy, however, does not align with the primary goal of protein engineering, which is to suggest a mutation rather than to identify what already appears in nature. Here we present Evolutionary Ranking (EvoRank), a training objective that incorporates evolutionary information derived from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to learn more diverse protein representations. EvoRank corresponds to ranking amino-acid likelihoods in the probability distribution induced by an MSA. This objective forces models to learn the underlying evolutionary dynamics of a protein. Across a variety of phenotypes and datasets, we demonstrate that EvoRank leads to dramatic improvements in zero-shot performance and can compete with models fine-tuned on experimental data.

Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked to the NP-hard *Spectral Radius Minimization* (SRM) problem, they assumed that the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and vaccination algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Generating molecules with high binding affinities to target proteins (a.k.a. structure-based drug design) is a fundamental and challenging task in drug discovery. Recently, deep generative models have achieved remarkable success in generating 3D molecules conditioned on the protein pocket. However, most existing methods consider molecular generation for protein pockets independently while neglecting the underlying connections such as subpocket-level similarities. Subpockets are the local protein environments of ligand fragments and pockets with similar subpockets may bind the same molecular fragment (motif) even though their overall structures are different. Therefore, the trained models can hardly generalize to unseen protein pockets in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method DrugGPS for generalizable structure-based drug design. With the biochemical priors, we propose to learn subpocket prototypes and construct a global interaction graph to model the interactions between subpocket prototypes and molecular motifs. Moreover, a hierarchical graph transformer encoder and motif-based 3D molecule generation scheme are used to improve the model's performance. The experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms baselines in generating realistic drug candidates with high affinities in challenging out-of-distribution settings.",

Manually annotated Regions of Interest (ROI) are often used to isolate the most informative parts of the image. However, these are expensive to collect and may vary significantly across annotators. To overcome these issues, we propose a framework that employs saliency maps to obtain soft spatial attention masks that modulate the image features at different scales. We refer to our method as *Adversarial Counterfactual Attention* (ACAT). ACAT increases the baseline classification accuracy of lesions in brain CT scans from $71.39 \\%$ to $72.55 \\%$ and of COVID-19 related findings in lung CT scans from $67.71 \\%$ to $70.84 \\%$ and exceeds the performance of competing methods. We investigate the best way to generate the saliency maps employed in our architecture and propose a way to obtain them from adversarially generated counterfactual images. They are able to isolate the area of interest in brain and lung CT scans without using any manual annotations. In the task of localising the lesion location out of 6 possible regions, they obtain a score of $65.05 \\%$ on brain CT scans, improving the score of $61.29 \\%$ obtained with the best competing method.",

    "abstract": "Coordinate denoising is a promising 3D molecular pre-training method, which has achieved remarkable performance in various downstream drug discovery tasks. Theoretically, the objective is equivalent to learning the force field, which is revealed helpful for downstream tasks. Nevertheless, there are two challenges for coordinate denoising to learn an effective force field, i.e. low coverage samples and isotropic force field. The underlying reason is that molecular distributions assumed by existing denoising methods fail to capture the anisotropic characteristic of molecules. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid noise strategy, including noises on both dihedral angel and coordinate. However, denoising such hybrid noise in a traditional way is no more equivalent to learning the force field. Through theoretical deductions, we find that the problem is caused by the dependency of the input conformation for covariance. To this end, we propose to decouple the two types of noise and design a novel fractional denoising method (Frad), which only denoises the latter coordinate part. In this way, Frad enjoys both the merits of sampling more low-energy structures and the force field equivalence. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of Frad in molecule representation, with a new state-of-the-art on 9 out of 12 tasks of QM9 and on 7 out of 8 targets of MD17.",

Existing approaches to pathology image segmentation are hindered by labor-intensive annotation processes and limited accuracy in tail-class identification, primarily due to the long-tail distribution inherent in gigapixel pathology images. In this work, we introduce the Laplace Diffusion Model, referred to as L-Diffusion, an innovative framework tailored for efficient pathology image segmentation. L-Diffusion utilizes multiple Laplace distributions, as opposed to Gaussian distributions, to model distinct components\u2014a methodology supported by theoretical analysis that significantly enhances the decomposition of features within the feature space. A sequence of feature maps is initially generated through a series of diffusion steps. Following this, contrastive learning is employed to refine the pixel-wise vectors derived from the feature map sequence.  By utilizing these highly discriminative pixel-wise vectors, the segmentation module achieves a harmonious balance of precision and robustness with remarkable efficiency. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that L-Diffusion attains improvements of up to  7.16\\%,  26.74\\%,  16.52\\%, and  3.55\\% on tissue segmentation datasets, and  20.09\\%,  10.67\\%,  14.42\\%, and  10.41\\% on cell segmentation datasets, as quantified by DICE, MPA, mIoU, and FwIoU metrics.

We find existing methods perform differently relative to each other than observed in vision benchmarks, and sometimes perform worse than no adaptation at all. We propose a new simple method which outperforms the existing methods on our new shifts while exhibiting strong performance on a range of vision datasets.

Therefore, predicting behaviour from neural population recordings has been shown to be most effective when using latent variable models. Over time however, the activity of single neurons can drift, and different neurons will be recorded due to movement of implanted neural probes. This means that a decoder trained to predict behaviour on one day performs worse when tested on a different day. On the other hand, evidence suggests that the latent dynamics underlying behaviour may be stable even over months and years. Based on this idea, we introduce a model capable of inferring behaviourally relevant latent dynamics from previously unseen data recorded from the same animal, without any need for decoder recalibration. We show that unsupervised domain adaptation combined with a sequential variational autoencoder, trained on several sessions, can achieve good generalisation to unseen data and correctly predict behaviour where conventional methods fail. Our results further support the hypothesis that behaviour-related neural dynamics are low-dimensional and stable over time, and will enable more effective and flexible use of brain computer interface technologies.",

Previous approaches for AFA have employed either: deep learning RL techniques, which have difficulty training policies due to a complicated state and action space; deep learning surrogate generative models, which require modeling complicated multidimensional conditional distributions; or greedy policies, which cannot account for jointly informative feature acquisitions. We show that we can bypass many of these challenges with a novel, nonparametric oracle based approach, which we coin the acquisition conditioned oracle (ACO).

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein structural tokenization methods, which chunk protein 3D structures into discrete or continuous representations. Structure tokenization enables the direct application of powerful techniques like language modeling for protein structures, and large multimodal models to integrate structures with protein sequences and functional texts. Despite the progress, the capabilities and limitations of these methods remain poorly understood due to the lack of a unified evaluation framework. We first introduce **StructTokenBench**, a framework that comprehensively evaluates the quality and efficiency of structure tokenizers, focusing on fine-grained local substructures rather than global structures, as typical in existing benchmarks. Our evaluations reveal that no single model dominates all benchmarking perspectives. Observations of codebook under-utilization led us to develop **AminoAseed**, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances codebook gradient updates and optimally balances codebook size and dimension for improved tokenizer utilization and quality. Compared to the leading model ESM3, our method achieves an average of 6.31\\% performance improvement across 24 supervised tasks, with sensitivity and utilization rates increased by 12.83\\% and 124.03\\%, respectively.

Traditional physics-based computational methods, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, suffer from rare event sampling and long equilibration time problems, hindering their applications in general protein systems. Recently, deep generative modeling techniques, especially diffusion models, have been employed to generate novel protein conformations. However, existing score-based diffusion methods cannot properly incorporate important physical prior knowledge to guide the generation process, causing large deviations in the sampled protein conformations from the equilibrium distribution. In this paper, to overcome these limitations, we propose a force-guided $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ diffusion model, ConfDiff, for protein conformation generation. By incorporating a force-guided network with a mixture of data-based score models, ConfDiff can generate protein conformations with rich diversity while preserving high fidelity. Experiments on a variety of protein conformation prediction tasks, including 12 fast-folding proteins and the Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI), demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method.",

    "abstract": "De novo protein design aims to create novel protein structures and sequences unseen in nature. Recent structure-oriented design methods typically employ a two-stage strategy, where structure design and sequence design modules are trained separately, and the backbone structures and sequences are generated sequentially in inference. While diffusion-based generative models like RFdiffusion show great promise in structure design, they face inherent limitations within the two-stage framework. First, the sequence design module risks overfitting, as the accuracy of the generated structures may not align with that of the crystal structures used for training. Second, the sequence design module lacks interaction with the structure design module to further optimize the generated structures. To address these challenges, we propose CarbonNovo, a unified energy-based model for jointly generating protein structure and sequence. Specifically, we leverage a score-based generative model and Markov Random Fields for describing the energy landscape of protein structure and sequence. In CarbonNovo, the structure and sequence design module communicates at each diffusion step, encouraging the generation of more coherent structure-sequence pairs. Moreover, the unified framework allows for incorporating the protein language models as evolutionary constraints for generated proteins. The rigorous evaluation demonstrates that CarbonNovo outperforms two-stage methods across various metrics, including designability, novelty, sequence plausibility, and Rosetta Energy.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) for clinical time series data has received significant attention in recent literature, since these data are highly rich and provide important information about a patient's physiological state. However, most existing SSL methods for clinical time series are limited in that they are designed for unimodal time series, such as a sequence of structured features (e.g., lab values and vitals signs) or an individual high-dimensional physiological signal (e.g., an electrocardiogram). These existing methods cannot be readily extended to model time series that exhibit multimodality, with structured features and high-dimensional data being recorded at each timestep in the sequence. In this work, we address this gap and propose a new SSL method --- Sequential Multi-Dimensional SSL --- where a SSL loss is applied both at the level of the entire sequence and at the level of the individual high-dimensional data points in the sequence in order to better capture information at both scales. Our strategy is agnostic to the specific form of loss function used at each level -- it can be contrastive, as in SimCLR, or non-contrastive, as in VICReg. We evaluate our method on two real-world clinical datasets, where the time series contains sequences of (1) high-frequency electrocardiograms and (2) structured data from lab values and vitals signs. Our experimental results indicate that pre-training with our method and then fine-tuning on downstream tasks improves performance over baselines on both datasets, and in several settings, can lead to improvements across different self-supervised loss functions.",

To resolve this problem, most existing studies attempted to transfer stable information to unseen environments. Particularly, independent causal mechanisms-based methods proposed to remove mutable causal mechanisms via the do-operator. Compared to previous methods, the obtained stable predictors are more effective in identifying stable information. However, a key question remains: which subset of this whole stable information should the model transfer, in order to achieve optimal generalization ability? To answer this question, we present a comprehensive minimax analysis from a causal perspective. Specifically, we first provide a graphical condition for the whole stable set to be optimal. When this condition fails, we surprisingly find with an example that this whole stable set, although can fully exploit stable information, is not the optimal one to transfer. To identify the optimal subset under this case, we propose to estimate the worst-case risk with a novel optimization scheme over the intervention functions on mutable causal mechanisms. We then propose an efficient algorithm to search for the subset with minimal worst-case risk, based on a newly defined equivalence relation between stable subsets. Compared to the exponential cost of exhaustively searching over all subsets, our searching strategy enjoys a polynomial complexity. The effectiveness and efficiency of our methods are demonstrated on synthetic data and the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.",

While informative, these methods constrain our understanding of decision-making to short timescale behaviors driven by explicit goals. In natural environments, animals exhibit more complex, long-term behaviors driven by intrinsic motivations that are often unobservable. Recent works in time-varying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aim to capture shifting motivations in long-term, freely moving behaviors. However, a crucial challenge remains: animals make decisions based on their history, not just their current state. To address this, we introduce SWIRL (SWitching IRL), a novel framework that extends traditional IRL by incorporating time-varying, history-dependent reward functions. SWIRL models long behavioral sequences as transitions between short-term decision-making processes, each governed by a unique reward function. SWIRL incorporates biologically plausible history dependency to capture how past decisions and environmental contexts shape behavior, offering a more accurate description of animal decision-making. We apply SWIRL to simulated and real-world animal behavior datasets and show that it outperforms models lacking history dependency, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This work presents the first IRL model to incorporate history-dependent policies and rewards to advance our understanding of complex, naturalistic decision-making in animals.",

Recently, microelectrode-dot-array (MEDA) biochips have been proposed to advance microfluidics technology. A MEDA biochip manipulates droplets of nano/picoliter volumes to automatically execute biochemical protocols. During bioassay execution, droplets are transported in parallel to achieve high-throughput outcomes. However, a major concern associated with the use of MEDA biochips is microelectrode degradation over time. Recent work has shown that formulating droplet transportation as a reinforcement-learning (RL) problem enables the training of policies to capture the underlying health conditions of microelectrodes and ensure reliable fluidic operations. However, the above RL-based approach suffers from two key limitations: 1) it cannot be used for concurrent transportation of multiple droplets; 2) it requires the availability of CCD cameras for monitoring droplet movement. To overcome these problems, we present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) droplet-routing solution that can be used for various sizes of MEDA biochips with integrated sensors, and we demonstrate the reliable execution of a serial-dilution bioassay with the MARL droplet router on a fabricated MEDA biochip. To facilitate further research, we also present a simulation environment based on the PettingZoo Gym Interface for MARL-guided droplet-routing problems on MEDA biochips.",

    "abstract": "Offline model-based optimization aims to maximize a black-box objective function with a static dataset of designs and their scores. In this paper, we focus on biological sequence design to maximize some sequence score. A recent approach employs bidirectional learning, combining a forward mapping for exploitation and a backward mapping for constraint, and it relies on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of an infinitely wide network to build a proxy model. Though effective, the NTK cannot learn features because of its parametrization, and its use prevents the incorporation of powerful pre-trained Language Models (LMs) that can capture the rich biophysical information in millions of biological sequences. We adopt an alternative proxy model, adding a linear head to a pre-trained LM, and propose a linearization scheme. This yields a closed-form loss and also takes into account the biophysical information in the pre-trained LM. In addition, the forward mapping and the backward mapping play different roles and thus deserve different weights during sequence optimization. To achieve this, we train an auxiliary model and leverage its weak supervision signal via a bi-level optimization framework to effectively learn how to balance the two mappings. Further, by extending the framework, we develop the first learning rate adaptation module *Adaptive*-$\\eta$, which is compatible with all gradient-based algorithms for offline model-based optimization. Experimental results on DNA/protein sequence design tasks verify the effectiveness of our algorithm. Our code is available at https://github.com/GGchen1997/BIB-ICML2023-Submission.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian inference provides a principled framework for learning from complex data and reasoning under uncertainty. It has been widely applied in machine learning tasks such as medical diagnosis, drug design, and policymaking. In these common applications, data can be highly sensitive. Differential privacy (DP) offers data analysis tools with powerful worst-case privacy guarantees and has been developed as the leading approach in privacy-preserving data analysis. In this paper, we study Metropolis-Hastings (MH), one of the most fundamental MCMC methods, for large-scale Bayesian inference under differential privacy. While most existing private MCMC algorithms sacrifice accuracy and efficiency to obtain privacy, we provide the first exact and fast DP MH algorithm, using only a minibatch of data in most iterations. We further reveal, for the first time, a three-way trade-off among privacy, scalability (i.e. the batch size), and efficiency (i.e. the convergence rate), theoretically characterizing how privacy affects the utility and computational cost in Bayesian inference. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm in various experiments.",

    "abstract": "Reliable probability estimation is of crucial importance in many real-world applications where there is inherent (aleatoric) uncertainty. Probability-estimation models are trained on observed outcomes (e.g. whether it has rained or not, or whether a patient has died or not), because the ground-truth probabilities of the events of interest are typically unknown. The problem is therefore analogous to binary classification, with the difference that the objective is to estimate probabilities rather than predicting the specific outcome. This work investigates probability estimation from high-dimensional data using deep neural networks. There exist several methods to improve the probabilities generated by these models but they mostly focus on model (epistemic) uncertainty. For problems with inherent uncertainty, it is challenging to evaluate performance without access to ground-truth probabilities. To address this, we build a synthetic dataset to study and compare different computable metrics. We evaluate existing methods on the synthetic data as well as on three real-world probability estimation tasks, all of which involve inherent uncertainty: precipitation forecasting from radar images, predicting cancer patient survival from histopathology images, and predicting car crashes from dashcam videos. We also give a theoretical analysis of a model for high-dimensional probability estimation which reproduces several of the phenomena evinced in our experiments. Finally, we propose a new method for probability estimation using neural networks, which modifies the training process to promote output probabilities that are consistent with empirical probabilities computed from the data. The method outperforms existing approaches on most metrics on the simulated as well as real-world data.",

For instance, models that associate cats with bed backgrounds can fail to predict the existence of cats in other environments without beds. Mitigating spurious correlations is crucial in building trustworthy models. However, the existing works lack transparency to offer insights into the mitigation process. In this work, we propose an interpretable framework, Discover and Cure (DISC), to tackle the issue. With human-interpretable concepts, DISC iteratively 1) discovers unstable concepts across different environments as spurious attributes, then 2) intervenes on the training data using the discovered concepts to reduce spurious correlation. Across systematic experiments, DISC provides superior generalization ability and interpretability than the existing approaches. Specifically, it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on an object recognition task and a skin-lesion classification task by 7.5% and 9.6%, respectively. Additionally, we offer theoretical analysis and guarantees to understand the benefits of models trained by DISC. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Wuyxin/DISC.",

Most existing deep-learning methods consider a protein as a 3D image by spatially clustering its atoms into voxels and then feed the voxelized protein into a 3D CNN for prediction. However, the CNN-based methods encounter several critical issues: 1) defective in representing irregular protein structures; 2) sensitive to rotations; 3) insufficient to characterize the protein surface; 4) unaware of protein size shift. To address the above issues, this work proposes EquiPocket, an E(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) for binding site prediction, which comprises three modules: the first one to extract local geometric information for each surface atom, the second one to model both the chemical and spatial structure of protein and the last one to capture the geometry of the surface via equivariant message passing over the surface atoms. We further propose a dense attention output layer to alleviate the effect incurred by variable protein size. Extensive experiments on several representative benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework to the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised method for various applications, with a particular interest in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification. Due to the gigapixel resolution of WSI, applications of MIL in WSI typically necessitate a two-stage training scheme: first, extract features from the pre-trained backbone and then perform MIL aggregation. However, it is well-known that this suboptimal training scheme suffers from \"noisy\" feature embeddings from the backbone and inherent weak supervision, hindering MIL from learning rich and generalizable features. However, the most commonly used technique (i.e., dropout) for mitigating this issue has yet to be explored in MIL. In this paper, we empirically explore how effective the dropout can be in MIL. Interestingly, we observe that dropping the top-k most important instances within a bag leads to better performance and generalization even under noise attack. Based on this key observation, we propose a novel MIL-specific dropout method, termed MIL-Dropout, which systematically determines which instances to drop. Experiments on five MIL benchmark datasets and two WSI datasets demonstrate that MIL-Dropout boosts the performance of current MIL methods with a negligible computational cost. The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/ChongQingNoSubway/MILDropout}.",

We present Score-Fusion, a novel volumetric translation model that effectively learns 3D representations by ensembling perpendicularly trained 2D diffusion models in score function space. By carefully initializing our model to start with an average of 2D models as in existing models, we reduce 3D training to a fine-tuning process, mitigating computational and data demands. Furthermore, we explicitly design the 3D model's hierarchical layers to learn ensembles of 2D features, further enhancing efficiency and performance. Moreover, Score-Fusion naturally extends to multi-modality settings by fusing diffusion models conditioned on different inputs for flexible, accurate integration. We demonstrate that 3D representation is essential for better performance in downstream recognition tasks, such as tumor segmentation, where most segmentation models are based on 3D representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Score-Fusion achieves superior accuracy and volumetric fidelity in 3D medical image super-resolution and modality translation.

However, estimation is challenging when unconfoundedness as a standard assumption in the causal inference literature is violated. In this work, we leverage arbitrary (potentially high-dimensional) instruments to estimate bounds on the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We propose a novel approach for partial identification through a mapping of instruments to a discrete representation space so that we yield valid bounds on the CATE. This is crucial for reliable decision-making in real-world applications. (2) We derive a two-step procedure that learns tight bounds using a tailored neural partitioning of the latent instrument space. As a result, we avoid instability issues due to numerical approximations or adversarial training. Furthermore, our procedure aims to reduce the estimation variance in finite-sample settings to yield more reliable estimates. (3) We show theoretically that our procedure obtains valid bounds while reducing estimation variance. We further perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness across various settings. Overall, our procedure offers a novel path for practitioners to make use of potentially high-dimensional instruments (e.g., as in Mendelian randomization).",

We contribute to this research direction by designing a sequential Monte Carlo method for linear-Gaussian inverse problems which builds on ``decoupled diffusion\", where the generative process is designed such that larger updates to the sample are possible. The method is asymptotically exact and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our Decoupled Diffusion Sequential Monte Carlo (DDSMC) algorithm on both synthetic as well as protein and image data. Further, we demonstrate how the approach can be extended to discrete data.",

EHR data is essential for epidemiological study, more commonly referred to as cohort study, where patients with shared characteristics or similar diseases are analyzed over time. Unfortunately, existing studies on cohort modeling are limited, struggling to derive fine-grained cohorts or effectively utilize cohort information, which hinders their ability to uncover intrinsic relationships between cohorts. To this end, we propose NeuralCohort, a cohort-aware neural representation learning method that precisely segments patients into finer-grained cohorts via an innovative cohort contextualization mechanism and captures both intra- and inter-cohort information using a Biscale Cohort Learning Module. Designed as a plug-in, NeuralCohort integrates seamlessly with existing backbone models, enhancing their cohort analysis capabilities by infusing deep cohort insights into the representation learning processes. The effectiveness and generalizability of NeuralCohort are validated across extensive real-world EHR datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that NeuralCohort consistently improves the performance of various backbone models, achieving up to an 8.1% increase in AUROC.",

Recently, the combination of ML-based single-step reaction predictors with multi-step planners has led to promising results. However, the single-step predictors are mostly trained offline to optimize the single-step accuracy, without considering complete routes. Here, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the single-step predictor, by using a tree-shaped MDP to optimize complete routes. Specifically, we propose a novel online training algorithm, called Planning with Dual Value Networks (PDVN), which alternates between the planning phase and updating phase. In PDVN, we construct two separate value networks to predict the synthesizability and cost of molecules, respectively. To maintain the single-step accuracy, we design a two-branch network structure for the single-step predictor. On the widely-used USPTO dataset, our PDVN algorithm improves the search success rate of existing multi-step planners (e.g., increasing the success rate from 85.79% to 98.95% for Retro$^{\\ast}$, and reducing the number of model calls by half while solving 99.47% molecules for RetroGraph). Additionally, PDVN helps find shorter synthesis routes (e.g., reducing the average route length from 5.76 to 4.83 for Retro$^{\\ast}$, and from 5.63 to 4.78 for RetroGraph).",

Real-life applications, such as digital behavioral biomarker identification, often require the discovery of complex spatiotemporal patterns in multimodal data, which is largely under-explored. To fill this gap, we propose a novel model that integrates uniquely designed Deep Temporal Sets (DTS) with Evidential Reinforced Attentions (ERA). DTS captures complex temporal relationships in the input and generates a set-based representation, while ERA captures the policy network's uncertainty and conducts evidence-aware exploration to locate attentive regions in behavioral data. Using child-computer interaction data as a testing platform, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DTS-ERA in differentiating children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and typically developing children based on sequential multimodal visual and touch behaviors.

Challenges exist due to the complex sequence\u2013fold relationship, as well as the difficulties to capture the diversity of the sequences (therefore structures and functions) within a fold. To overcome these challenges, we propose Fold2Seq, a novel transformer-based generative framework for designing protein sequences conditioned on a specific target fold. To model the complex sequence\u2013structure relationship, Fold2Seq jointly learns a sequence embedding using a transformer and a fold embedding from the density of secondary structural elements in 3D voxels.

The unique advantages of fold-based Fold2Seq, in comparison to a structure-based deep model and RosettaDesign, become more evident on three additional real-world challenges originating from low-quality, incomplete, or ambiguous input structures.

A new thread of works have shown potential in advancing the specificity and success rate of in silico drug design by considering the structure of protein pockets. This setting posts fundamental computational challenges in sampling new chemical compounds that could satisfy multiple geometrical constraints imposed by pockets. Previous sampling algorithms either sample in the graph space or only consider the 3D coordinates of atoms while ignoring other detailed chemical structures such as bond types and functional groups. To address the challenge, we develop an E(3)-equivariant generative network composed of two modules: 1) a new graph neural network capturing both spatial and bonding relationships between atoms of the binding pockets and 2) a new efficient algorithm which samples new drug candidates conditioned on the pocket representations from a tractable distribution without relying on MCMC. Experimental results demonstrate that molecules sampled from Pocket2Mol achieve significantly better binding affinity and other drug properties such as drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility.",

Recently, instead of generating long molecular dynamics simulations, generative machine learning methods such as normalizing flows have been used to learn the Boltzmann distribution directly, without samples. However, this approach is susceptible to mode collapse and thus often does not explore the full configurational space. In this work, we address this challenge by separating the problem into two levels, the fine-grained and coarse-grained degrees of freedom. A normalizing flow conditioned on the coarse-grained space yields a probabilistic connection between the two levels. To explore the configurational space, we employ coarse-grained simulations with active learning which allows us to update the flow and make all-atom potential energy evaluations only when necessary. Using alanine dipeptide as an example, we show that our methods obtain a speedup to molecular dynamics simulations of approximately $15.9$ to $216.2$ compared to the speedup of $4.5$ of the current state-of-the-art machine learning approach.",

We introduce prospector heads, an efficient and interpretable alternative to explanation-based attribution methods that can be applied to any encoder and any data modality. Prospector heads generalize across modalities through experiments on sequences (text), images (pathology), and graphs (protein structures), outperforming baseline attribution methods by up to 26.3 points in mean localization AUPRC. We also demonstrate how prospector heads enable improved interpretation and discovery of class-specific patterns in input data.

Due to the nonstationary property of neural signals, BCIs trained on one day usually obtain degraded performance on other days, hindering the user experience. Existing studies attempted to address this problem by aligning neural signals across different days. However, these neural adaptation methods may exhibit  instability and poor performance when only a few trials are available for alignment, limiting their practicality in real-world BCI deployment. To achieve efficient and stable neural adaptation with few trials, we propose Flow-Based Distribution Alignment (FDA), a novel framework that utilizes flow matching to learn flexible neural representations with stable latent dynamics, thereby facilitating source-free domain alignment through likelihood maximization. The latent dynamics of FDA framework is theoretically proven to be stable using Lyapunov exponents, allowing for robust adaptation. Further experiments across multiple motor cortex datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FDA, achieving reliable results with fewer than five trials. Our FDA approach offers a novel and efficient solution for few-trial neural data adaptation, offering significant potential for improving the long-term viability of real-world BCI applications.",

In this paper, we formulate OPE and OPL using principal stratification under \"truncation by death\".

We establish a novel identification strategy under principal ignorability, and derive the semiparametric efficiency bound of an OPE estimator.

We show that the proposed estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal even with flexible semi/nonparametric models for nuisance functions approximation.

Popular explainability methods have demonstrated satisfactory results in natural image recognition, yet in medical image analysis, many of these approaches provide partial and noisy explanations. Recently, attention mechanisms have shown compelling results both in their predictive performance and in their interpretable qualities. A fundamental trait of attention is that it leverages salient parts of the input which contribute to the model\u2019s prediction. To this end, our work focuses on the explanatory value of attention weight distributions. We propose a multi-layer attention mechanism that enforces consistent interpretations between attended convolutional layers using convex optimization. We apply duality to decompose the consistency constraints between the layers by reparameterizing their attention probability distributions. We further suggest learning the dual witness by optimizing with respect to our objective; thus, our implementation uses standard back-propagation, hence it is highly efficient. While preserving predictive performance, our proposed method leverages weakly annotated medical imaging data and provides complete and faithful explanations to the model\u2019s prediction.",

Despite the considerable progress we have achieved, existing methods usually generate molecules in atom resolution and ignore intrinsic local structures such as rings, which leads to poor quality in generated structures, especially when generating large molecules. Fragment-based molecule generation is a promising strategy, however, it is nontrivial to be adapted for 3D non-autoregressive generations because of the combinational optimization problems. In this paper, we utilize a coarse-to-fine strategy to tackle this problem, in which a Hierarchical Diffusion-based model (i.e. HierDiff) is proposed to preserve the validity of local segments without relying on autoregressive modeling. Specifically, HierDiff first generates coarse-grained molecule geometries via an equivariant diffusion process, where each coarse-grained node reflects a fragment in a molecule. Then the coarse-grained nodes are decoded into fine-grained fragments by a message-passing process and a newly designed iterative refined sampling module. Lastly, the fine-grained fragments are then assembled to derive a complete atomic molecular structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HierDiff consistently improves the quality of molecule generation over existing methods.",

Our extensive analysis shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.5\\%) over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current architectures may require  redesign to fully leverage the potential of foundation models in brainwave analysis.",

In this work, we introduce CFP-GEN, a novel diffusion language model for Combinatorial Functional Protein GENeration. CFP-GEN facilitates the de novo protein design by integrating multimodal conditions with functional, sequence, and structural constraints. Specifically, an Annotation-Guided Feature Modulation (AGFM) module is introduced to dynamically adjust the protein feature distribution based on composable functional annotations, e.g., GO terms, IPR domains and EC numbers. Meanwhile, the ResidueControlled Functional Encoding (RCFE) module captures residue-wise interaction to ensure more precise control. Additionally, off-the-shelf 3D structure encoders can be seamlessly integrated to impose geometric constraints. We demonstrate that CFP-GEN enables high-throughput generation of novel proteins with functionality comparable to natural proteins, while achieving a high success rate in designing multifunctional proteins.",

To generate truly novel molecules that may have even better properties for de novo drug discovery, more powerful exploration in the chemical space is necessary. To this end, we propose Molecular Out-Of-distribution Diffusion(MOOD), a score-based diffusion scheme that incorporates out-of-distribution (OOD) control in the generative stochastic differential equation (SDE) with simple control of a hyperparameter, thus requires no additional costs. Since some novel molecules may not meet the basic requirements of real-world drugs, MOOD performs conditional generation by utilizing the gradients from a property predictor that guides the reverse-time diffusion process to high-scoring regions according to target properties such as protein-ligand interactions, drug-likeness, and synthesizability. This allows MOOD to search for novel and meaningful molecules rather than generating unseen yet trivial ones. We experimentally validate that MOOD is able to explore the chemical space beyond the training distribution, generating molecules that outscore ones found with existing methods, and even the top 0.01% of the original training pool. Our code is available at https://github.com/SeulLee05/MOOD.",

To this end, we use kernel theory to propose a novel loss, called decoupled uniformity, that i) allows the integration of prior knowledge and ii) removes the positive-negative coupling in the original InfoNCE loss. We draw a connection between contrastive learning and the conditional mean embedding theory to derive tight bounds on the downstream classification loss.

For instance, as the medical community\u2019s understanding of organ transplantations has progressed over the years, a pertinent question is: How have actual organ allocation policies been evolving? To give an answer, we desire a policy learning method that provides interpretable representations of decision-making, in particular capturing an agent\u2019s non-stationary knowledge of the world, as well as operating in an offline manner. First, we model the evolving behavior of decision-makers in terms of contextual bandits, and formalize the problem of Inverse Contextual Bandits (\"ICB\").

Unfortunately the space of all possible causal graphs is enormous so scalably and accurately searching for the best fit to the data is a challenge. In principle we could substantially decrease the search space, or learn the graph entirely, by testing the conditional independence of variables. However, deciding if two variables are adjacent in a causal graph may require an exponential number of tests. Here we build a scalable and flexible method to evaluate if two variables are adjacent in a causal graph, the Differentiable Adjacency Test (DAT). DAT replaces an exponential number of tests with a provably equivalent relaxed problem. It then solves this problem by training two neural networks. We build a graph learning method based on DAT, DAT-Graph, that can also learn from data with interventions. DAT-Graph can learn graphs of 1000 variables with state of the art accuracy. Using the graph learned by DAT-Graph, we also build models that make much more accurate predictions of the effects of interventions on large scale RNA sequencing data.",

This perspective provides us with a scalable and flexible framework that can be re-purposed for a wide range of tasks and assumptions on the generative model. Specifically, the iterative optimization procedure for solving CDL, an unsupervised task, is mapped to an unfolded and constrained neural network, with iterative adjustments to the inputs to account for the generative distribution. We also show that the framework can easily be extended for discriminative training, appropriate for a supervised task. We 1) demonstrate that fitting the generative model to learn, in an unsupervised fashion, the latent stimulus that underlies neural spiking data leads to better goodness-of-fit compared to other baselines, 2) show competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for supervised Poisson image denoising, with significantly fewer parameters, and 3) characterize the gradient dynamics of the shallow binomial auto-encoder.",

Thanks to their fast inference times they promise to accelerate computational chemistry applications. Unfortunately, despite low in-distribution (ID) errors, such GNNs might be horribly wrong for out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Uncertainty estimation (UE) may aid in such situations by communicating the model's certainty about its prediction. Here, we take a closer look at the problem and identify six key desiderata for UE in molecular force fields, three 'physics-informed' and three 'application-focused' ones. To overview the field, we survey existing methods from the field of UE and analyze how they fit to the set desiderata. By our analysis, we conclude that none of the previous works satisfies all criteria. To fill this gap, we propose Localized Neural Kernel (LNK) a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNNs satisfying the desiderata. In our extensive experimental evaluation, we test four different UE with three different backbones across two datasets. In out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout or evidential regression-based methods while maintaining high predictive performance.",

In particular, although ODEs are differentiable and would allow for gradient-based parameter optimization, the nonlinear dynamics of ODEs often lead to many local minima and extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. We therefore propose diffusion tempering, a novel regularization technique for probabilistic numerical methods which improves convergence of gradient-based parameter optimization in ODEs. By iteratively reducing a noise parameter of the probabilistic integrator, the proposed method converges more reliably to the true parameters. We demonstrate that our method is effective for dynamical systems of different complexity and show that it obtains reliable parameter estimates for a Hodgkin--Huxley model with a practically relevant number of parameters.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the problem of federated learning (FL) with private data from people who do not trust the server or other silos/clients. In this context, every silo (e.g. hospital) has data from several people (e.g. patients) and needs to protect the privacy of each person's data (e.g. health records), even if the server and/or other silos try to uncover this data. Inter-Silo Record-Level Differential Privacy (ISRL-DP) prevents each silo's data from being leaked, by requiring that silo $i$'s *communications* satisfy item-level differential privacy. Prior work (Lowy & Razaviyayn, 2023a) characterized the optimal excess risk bounds for ISRL-DP algorithms with *homogeneous* (i.i.d.) silo data and convex loss functions. However, two important questions were left open: 1) Can the same excess risk bounds be achieved with *heterogeneous* (non-i.i.d.) silo data? 2) Can the optimal risk bounds be achieved with *fewer communication rounds*? In this paper, we give positive answers to both questions. We provide novel ISRL-DP FL algorithms that achieve the optimal excess risk bounds in the presence of heterogeneous silo data. Moreover, our algorithms are more *communication-efficient* than the prior state-of-the-art. For smooth loss functions, our algorithm achieves the *optimal* excess risk bound and has *communication complexity that matches the non-private lower bound*. Additionally, our algorithms are more *computationally efficient* than the previous state-of-the-art.",

These challenges include the scarcity of 3D structural data on target proteins and associated cyclic peptide ligands, the geometric constraints that cyclization imposes, and the involvement of non-canonical amino acids in cyclization. To address the above challenges, we introduce CpSDE, which consists of two key components: AtomSDE, a generative structure prediction model based on harmonic SDE, and ResRouter, a residue type predictor. Utilizing a routed sampling algorithm that alternates between these two models to iteratively update sequences and structures, CpSDE facilitates the generation of cyclic peptides. By employing explicit all-atom and bond modeling, CpSDE overcomes existing data limitations and is proficient in designing a wide variety of cyclic peptides.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that the cyclic peptides designed by our method exhibit reliable stability and affinity.",

This motivates us to propose a novel Self-PU learning framework, which seamlessly integrates PU learning and self-training. Self-PU highlights three \u201cself\u201d-oriented building blocks: a self-paced training algorithm that adaptively discovers and augments confident positive/negative examples as the training proceeds; a self-reweighted, instance-aware loss; and a self-distillation scheme that introduces teacher-students learning as an effective regularization for PU learning. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Self-PU on common PU learning benchmarks (MNIST and CIFAR10), which compare favorably against the latest competitors.

However, tasks such as biological sequence design involve searching for sequences that improve desirable properties beyond previously known values, which requires novel hypotheses that \\emph{extrapolate} beyond training data. In these settings, extrapolation may be achieved by using random search methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which, given an initial state, sample local transformations to approximate a target density that rewards states with the desired properties. However, even with a well-designed proposal, MCMC may struggle to explore large structured state spaces efficiently. Rather than relying on stochastic search, it would be desirable to have a model that greedily optimizes the properties of interest, successfully extrapolating in as few steps as possible. We propose to learn such a model from the Markov chains resulting from MCMC search. Specifically, our approach uses selected states from Markov chains as a source of training data for an autoregressive model, which is then able to efficiently generate novel sequences that extrapolate along the sequence-level properties of interest. The proposed approach is validated on three problems: protein sequence design, text sentiment control, and text anonymization. We find that the autoregressive model can extrapolate as well or better than MCMC, but with the additional benefits of scalability and significantly higher sample efficiency.",

Proposing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, we are the first to evaluate dynamic mediation effects in settings with infinite horizons. We decompose the average treatment effect into an immediate direct effect, an immediate mediation effect, a delayed direct effect, and a delayed mediation effect. Upon the identification of each effect component, we further develop robust and semi-parametrically efficient estimators under the RL framework to infer these causal effects. The superior performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies, theoretical results, and an analysis of a mobile health dataset.

In this paper, we first analyze AF2's primary loss function, known as the Frame Aligned Point Error (FAPE), and raise a previously overlooked issue that FAPE tends to face gradient vanishing problem on high-rotational-error targets. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a novel geodesic loss called Frame Aligned Frame Error (FAFE, denoted as F2E to distinguish from FAPE), which enables the model to better optimize both the rotational and translational errors between two frames. We then prove that F2E can be reformulated as a group-aware geodesic loss, which translates the optimization of the residue-to-residue error to optimizing group-to-group geodesic frame distance. By fine-tuning AF2 with our proposed new loss function, we attain a correct rate of 52.3% (DockQ > 0.23) on an evaluation set and 43.8% correct rate on a subset with low homology, with improvement over AF2 by 182% and 100% respectively.",

Existing computational approaches require a substantial amount of experimentally determined RNA sequences for each specific protein or a detailed knowledge of RNA structure, restricting their utility in practice. To address this limitation, we develop RNA-BAnG, a deep learning-based model designed to generate RNA sequences for protein interactions without these requirements. Central to our approach is a novel generative method, Bidirectional Anchored Generation (BAnG), which leverages the observation that protein-binding RNA sequences often contain functional binding motifs embedded within broader sequence contexts. We first validate our method on generic synthetic tasks involving similar localized motifs to those appearing in RNAs, demonstrating its benefits over existing generative approaches. We then evaluate our model on biological sequences, showing its effectiveness for conditional RNA sequence design given a binding protein.",

However, MSA-based retrieval is computationally expensive, struggles with highly divergent sequences or complex insertions & deletions patterns, and operates independently of the downstream modeling objective. We introduce Protriever, an end-to-end differentiable framework that learns to retrieve relevant homologs while simultaneously training for the target task. When applied to protein fitness prediction, Protriever achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to sequence-based models that rely on MSA-based homolog retrieval, while being two orders of magnitude faster through efficient vector search.

    "abstract": "Conventional community detection methods often categorize all nodes into clusters. However, the presumed community structure of interest may only be valid for a subset of nodes (named as `tight nodes'), while the rest of the network may consist of noninformative ``scattered nodes''. For example, a protein-protein network often contains proteins that do not belong to specific biological functional modules but are involved in more general processes, or act as bridges between different functional modules. Forcing each of these proteins into a single cluster introduces unwanted biases and obscures the underlying biological implication. To address this issue, we propose a tight community detection (TCD) method to identify tight communities excluding scattered nodes. The algorithm enjoys a strong theoretical guarantee of tight node identification accuracy and is scalable for large networks. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by various synthetic and real experiments.",

However, in many cases, our goal is to model parts of the distribution that maximize certain properties: for example, we may want to generate images with high aesthetic quality, or molecules with high bioactivity. It is natural to frame this as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, in which the objective is to finetune a diffusion model to maximize a reward function that corresponds to some property. Even with access to online queries of the ground-truth reward function, efficiently discovering high-reward samples can be challenging: they might have a low probability in the initial distribution, and there might be many infeasible samples that do not even have a well-defined reward (e.g., unnatural images or physically impossible molecules). In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning procedure that efficiently explores on the manifold of feasible samples. We present a theoretical analysis providing a regret guarantee, as well as empirical validation across three domains: images, biological sequences, and molecules.",

The capability to create new proteins with designed structures and functions would thus enable the engineering of cellular behavior and development of protein-based therapeutics and materials. Structure-based protein design aims to find structures that are designable (can be realized by a protein sequence), novel (have dissimilar geometry from natural proteins), and diverse (span a wide range of geometries). While advances in protein structure prediction have made it possible to predict structures of novel protein sequences, the combinatorially large space of sequences and structures limits the practicality of search-based methods. Generative models provide a compelling alternative, by implicitly learning the low-dimensional structure of complex data distributions. Here, we leverage recent advances in denoising diffusion probabilistic models and equivariant neural networks to develop Genie, a generative model of protein structures that performs discrete-time diffusion using a cloud of oriented reference frames in 3D space. Through in silico evaluations, we demonstrate that Genie generates protein backbones that are more designable, novel, and diverse than existing models. This indicates that Genie is capturing key aspects of the distribution of protein structure space and facilitates protein design with high success rates. Code for generating new proteins and training new versions of Genie is available at https://github.com/aqlaboratory/genie.",

However, in practice, only approximated projections are accessible and their convergence is not well understood. To fill this gap, we present a first convergence analysis of the Schr\u00f6dinger bridge algorithm based on approximated projections. As for its practical applications, we apply SBP to probabilistic time series imputation by generating missing values conditioned on observed data.

First, we present a self-supervised procedure to identify the subset of the most informative features from each data point. Then, we design a model that predicts cluster assignments and a gate matrix that provides cluster-level feature selection. Overall, our model provides cluster assignments with an indication of the driving feature for each sample and each cluster.

The Non-Euclidean property have posed a long term challenge in graph modeling. Despite recent graph neural networks and graph transformers efforts encoding graphs as Euclidean vectors, recovering the original graph from vectors remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce GraphsGPT, featuring an Graph2Seq encoder that transforms Non-Euclidean graphs into learnable Graph Words in the Euclidean space, along with a GraphGPT decoder that reconstructs the original graph from Graph Words to ensure information equivalence. We pretrain GraphsGPT on $100$M molecules and yield some interesting findings: (1) The pretrained Graph2Seq excels in graph representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on $8/9$ graph classification and regression tasks. (2) The pretrained GraphGPT serves as a strong graph generator, demonstrated by its strong ability to perform both few-shot and conditional graph generation. (3) Graph2Seq+GraphGPT enables effective graph mixup in the Euclidean space, overcoming previously known Non-Euclidean challenges. (4) The edge-centric pretraining framework GraphsGPT demonstrates its efficacy in graph domain tasks, excelling in both representation and generation.

This CI should have a width at most $\\epsilon$ while ensuring that the probability of the CI not containing the true ATE is at most $\\delta$. To answer this, we first establish a lower bound on the expected sample size needed for any adaptive policy which constructs a CI of ATE with desired properties. Specifically, we prove that the lower bound is based on the solution to a max-min non-convex optimization problem for small $\\delta$. Tailoring the ``plug-in'' approach for the ATE problem, we construct an adaptive policy that is asymptotically optimal, i.e., matches the lower bound on the expected sample size for small $\\delta$. Interestingly, we find that, for small $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$, the asymptotically optimal fraction of treatment assignment for A and B is proportional to the standard deviation of the outcome distributions of treatments A and B, respectively. However, as the proposed approach can be computationally intensive, we propose an alternative adaptive policy. This new policy, informed by insights from our lower bound analysis, is computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal for small values of $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$. Numerical comparisons demonstrate that both policies perform similarly across practical values of $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$, offering efficient solutions for A/B testing.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal morphology is essential for studying brain functioning and understanding neurodegenerative disorders. As acquiring real-world morphology data is expensive, computational approaches for morphology generation have been studied. Traditional methods heavily rely on expert-set rules and parameter tuning, making it difficult to generalize across different types of morphologies. Recently, MorphVAE was introduced as the sole learning-based method, but its generated morphologies lack plausibility, i.e., they do not appear realistic enough and most of the generated samples are topologically invalid. To fill this gap, this paper proposes **MorphGrower**, which mimicks the neuron natural growth mechanism for generation. Specifically, MorphGrower generates morphologies layer by layer, with each subsequent layer conditioned on the previously generated structure. During each layer generation, MorphGrower utilizes a pair of sibling branches as the basic generation block and generates branch pairs synchronously. This approach ensures topological validity and allows for fine-grained generation, thereby enhancing the realism of the final generated morphologies. Results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MorphGrower outperforms MorphVAE by a notable margin. Importantly, the electrophysiological response simulation demonstrates the plausibility of our generated samples from a neuroscience perspective.

The current architectures are bottlenecked because they fail to effectively capture the hierarchical processing of visual stimuli that takes place in the human brain.

Our architecture uses Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders (HVAEs) to learn meaningful representations of natural images and leverages their latent space hierarchy to learn voxel-to-image mappings. By mapping the early stages of the visual pathway to the first set of latent variables and the higher visual cortex areas to the deeper layers in the latent hierarchy, we are able to construct a latent variable neural decoding model that replicates the hierarchical visual information processing. Our model achieves better reconstructions compared to the state of the art and our ablation study indicates that the hierarchical structure of the latent space is responsible for that performance.",

Among them, graph diffusion models achieve superior performance but face inefficient sampling and limited flexibility due to the tight coupling between training and sampling stages. We introduce DeFoG, a novel graph generative framework that disentangles sampling from training, enabling a broader design space for more effective and efficient model optimization. DeFoG employs a discrete flow-matching formulation that respects the inherent symmetries of graphs. We theoretically ground this disentangled formulation by explicitly relating the training loss to the sampling algorithm and showing that DeFoG faithfully replicates the ground truth graph distribution. Building on these foundations, we thoroughly investigate DeFoG's design space and propose novel sampling methods that significantly enhance performance and reduce the required number of refinement steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across synthetic, molecular, and digital pathology datasets, covering both unconditional and conditional generation settings. It also outperforms most diffusion-based models with just 5\u201310\\% of their sampling steps.",

    "abstract": "The progress in materials science and drug discovery is impeded by the availability of labeled data and the high costs of manual annotation, driving the need for efficient strategies to capture molecular representations and enable accurate predictions. Pretrained Graph Neural Networks have shown promise in capturing universal molecular representations, but adapting them to task-specific applications remains challenging. In this paper, we propose Multilevel Informed Prompt-Tuning (MIPT), a novel framework for effectively tailoring pretrained models to molecule-related tasks. MIPT utilizes a lightweight, multi-level prompt learning module to capture node-level and graph-level task-specific knowledge, ensuring adaptable and efficient tuning. Additionally, a noise penalty mechanism is introduced to address mismatches between pretrained representations and downstream tasks, reducing irrelevant or noisy information. Experimental results show that MIPT surpasses all baselines, aligning graph space and task space while achieving significant improvements in molecule-related tasks, demonstrating its scalability and versatility for molecular tasks.",

We show that naive linear flow matching on the simplex is insufficient toward this goal since it suffers from discontinuities in the training target and further pathologies. To overcome this, we develop Dirichlet flow matching on the simplex based on mixtures of Dirichlet distributions as probability paths. In this framework, we derive a connection between the mixtures' scores and the flow's vector field that allows for classifier and classifier-free guidance. Further, we provide distilled Dirichlet flow matching, which enables one-step sequence generation with minimal performance hits, resulting in $O(L)$ speedups compared to autoregressive models. On complex DNA sequence generation tasks, we demonstrate superior performance compared to all baselines in distributional metrics and in achieving desired design targets for generated sequences. Finally, we show that our classifier-free guidance approach improves unconditional generation and is effective for generating DNA that satisfies design targets.",

They have become essential tools for researchers and practitioners in biology. However, the hand-crafted tokenization policies used in these models may not encode the most discriminative patterns from the limited vocabulary of genomic data. In this paper, we introduce VQDNA, a general-purpose framework that renovates genome tokenization from the perspective of genome vocabulary learning. By leveraging vector-quantized codebook as learnable vocabulary, VQDNA can adaptively tokenize genomes into pattern-aware embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To further push its limits, we propose Hierarchical Residual Quantization (HRQ), where varying scales of codebooks are designed in a hierarchy to enrich the genome vocabulary in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on 32 genome datasets demonstrate VQDNA's superiority and favorable parameter efficiency compared to existing genome language models. Notably, empirical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mutations reveals the fine-grained pattern awareness and biological significance of learned HRQ vocabulary, highlighting its untapped potential for broader applications in genomics.",

Motivated by such prior and recent advancements in the generative paradigm, we propose Graph Bayesian Flow Networks (GraphBFN) in this paper, a principled generative framework that designs an alternative generative process emphasizing the dynamics of topological information. Unlike recent discrete-diffusion-based methods, GraphBFNemploys the continuous counts derived from sampling infinite times from a categorical distribution as latent to facilitate a smooth decomposition of topological information, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness. To effectively realize the concept, we further develop an advanced sampling strategy and new time-scheduling techniques to overcome practical barriers and boost performance. Through extensive experimental validation on both generic graph and molecular graph generation tasks, GraphBFN could consistently achieve superior or competitive performance with significantly higher training and sampling efficiency.",

Due to the excessively large search space of the subset selection problem, prior methods optimize the batch acquisition on the latent space, which has discrepancies with the actual space, or optimize individual acquisition scores without considering the dependencies among candidates in a batch instead of directly optimizing the batch acquisition. To manage the vast search space, a simple and effective approach is the greedy method, which decomposes the problem into smaller subproblems, yet it has difficulty in parallelization since each subproblem depends on the outcome from the previous ones. To this end, we introduce a novel greedy-style subset selection algorithm that optimizes batch acquisition directly on the combinatorial space by sequential greedy sampling from the greedy policy, specifically trained to address all greedy subproblems concurrently. Notably, our experiments on the red fluorescent proteins design task show that our proposed method achieves the baseline performance in 1.69x fewer queries, demonstrating its efficiency.",

Our contributions are two-fold: (1) we propose a novel betting scheme and provide theoretical guarantees on type-I error control, power, and asymptotic growth rate/$e$-power in the setting of a single data stream; (2) we introduce PEAK, a generalization of this betting scheme to multiple streams, that (i) avoids using wasteful union bounds via averaging, (ii) is a test of power one under mild regularity conditions on the sampling scheme of the streams, and (iii) reduces computational overhead when applying the testing-as-betting approaches for pure-exploration bandit problems. We illustrate the practical benefits of PEAK using both synthetic and real-world HeartSteps datasets.

Existing solutions leverage protein knowledge graphs (PKGs) as auxiliary pre-training objectives, but lack explicit integration of task-oriented knowledge, making them suffer from limited knowledge exploitation and catastrophic forgetting. The root cause is that they fail to align PKGs with task-specific data, forcing their knowledge modeling to adapt to the knowledge-isolated nature of downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose Knowledge-aware retrieval augmented protein language model (Kara), achieving the first task-oriented and explicit integration of PKGs and protein language models. With a knowledge retriever learning to predict linkages between PKG and task proteins, Kara unifies the knowledge integration of the pre-training and fine-tuning stages with a structure-based regularization, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To ensure task-oriented integration, Kara uses contextualized virtual tokens to extract graph context as task-specific knowledge for new proteins. Experiments show that Kara outperforms existing knowledge-enhanced models in 6 representative tasks, achieving on average 5.1% improvements.",

    "abstract": "It is increasingly common to encounter data in the form of cross-sectional population measurements over time, particularly in biomedical settings. Recent attempts to model individual trajectories from this data use optimal transport to create pairwise matchings between time points. However, these methods cannot model non-linear paths common in many underlying dynamic systems. We establish a link between continuous normalizing flows and dynamic optimal transport to model the expected paths of points over time. Continuous normalizing flows are generally under constrained, as they are allowed to take an arbitrary path from the source to the target distribution. We present \\emph{TrajectoryNet}, which controls the continuous paths taken between distributions. We show how this is particularly applicable for studying cellular dynamics in data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, and that TrajectoryNet improves upon recently proposed static optimal transport-based models that can be used for interpolating cellular distributions.",

Addressing this fundamental data-centric problem has wide implications, especially in domains like healthcare, finance and e-commerce --- but also has the potential to benefit ML models more generally, by increasing the data available for ML model training. However, schema matching is a challenging ML task due to structural/hierarchical and semantic heterogeneity between different schemas. Previous ML approaches to automate schema matching have either required significant labeled data for model training, which is often unrealistic or suffer from poor zero-shot performance. To this end, we propose Matchmaker -  a compositional language model program for schema matching, comprised of candidate generation, refinement and confidence scoring. Matchmaker also self-improves in a zero-shot manner without the need for labeled demonstrations via a novel optimization approach, which constructs synthetic in-context demonstrations to guide the language model's reasoning process.  Empirically, we demonstrate on real-world medical schema matching benchmarks that Matchmaker outperforms previous ML-based approaches, highlighting its potential to accelerate data integration and interoperability of ML-ready data.",

However, current structure prediction methods predominantly yield a single  conformation, overlooking the conformational heterogeneity revealed by diverse experimental modalities. Here, we present a framework for building experiment-grounded protein structure generative models that infer conformational ensembles consistent with measured experimental data. The key idea is to treat state-of-the-art protein structure predictors (e.g., AlphaFold3) as sequence-conditioned structural priors, and cast ensemble modeling as posterior inference of protein structures given experimental measurements. Through extensive real-data experiments, we demonstrate the generality of our method to incorporate a variety of experimental measurements. In particular, our framework uncovers previously unmodeled conformational heterogeneity from crystallographic densities, generates high-accuracy NMR ensembles orders of magnitude faster than status quo, and incorporates pairwise cross-link constraints. Notably, we demonstrate that our ensembles outperform AlphaFold3 and sometimes better fit experimental data than publicly deposited structures to the protein database (PDB). We believe that this approach will unlock building predictive models that fully embrace experimentally observed conformational diversity.",

Many computational approaches have been proposed to estimate such *Monge* maps when $c$ is the squared-Euclidean distance, e.g., using entropic maps [Pooladian+2021], or input convex neural networks [Makkuva+2020, Korotin+2020]. We propose a new research direction, that leverages a specific translation invariant cost $c(x, y):=h(x-y)$ inspired by the elastic net. Here, $h:=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\|\\cdot\\|_2^2+\\tau(\\cdot)$, where $\\tau$ is a convex function. We highlight a surprising link tying together a generalized entropic map for $h$, *Bregman* centroids induced by $h$, and the proximal operator of $\\tau$. We show how setting $\\tau$ to be a sparsity-inducing norm results in the first application of *Occam*'s razor to transport. These maps yield, mechanically, displacement vectors $\\Delta(x):= T(x)-x$ that are sparse, with sparsity patterns that vary depending on $x$. We showcase the ability of our method to estimate meaningful OT maps for high-dimensional single-cell transcription data.

Motivated by the techniques from adversarial machine learning (ML) that are capable of manipulating the model prediction via data perturbations, in this paper we propose a novel approach, black-box adversarial reprogramming (BAR), that repurposes a well-trained black-box ML model (e.g., a prediction API or a proprietary software) for solving different ML tasks, especially in the scenario with scarce data and constrained resources. The rationale lies in exploiting high-performance but unknown ML models to gain learning capability for transfer learning. Using zeroth order optimization and multi-label mapping techniques, BAR can reprogram a black-box ML model solely based on its input-output responses without knowing the model architecture or changing any parameter. More importantly, in the limited medical data setting, on autism spectrum disorder classification, diabetic retinopathy detection, and melanoma detection tasks, BAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods and yields comparable performance to the vanilla adversarial reprogramming method requiring complete knowledge of the target ML model. BAR also outperforms baseline transfer learning approaches by a significant margin, demonstrating cost-effective means and new insights for transfer learning.",

However, computing pairwise Wasserstein distances rapidly becomes intractable as cohort size grows. An attractive alternative would be to find an embedding space in which pairwise Euclidean distances map to OT distances, akin to standard multidimensional scaling (MDS). We present Wasserstein Wormhole, a transformer-based autoencoder that embeds empirical distributions into a latent space wherein Euclidean distances approximate OT distances. Extending MDS theory, we show that our objective function implies a bound on the error incurred when embedding non-Euclidean distances. Empirically, distances between Wormhole embeddings closely match Wasserstein distances, enabling linear time computation of OT distances. Along with an encoder that maps distributions to embeddings, Wasserstein Wormhole includes a decoder that maps embeddings back to distributions, allowing for operations in the embedding space to generalize to OT spaces, such as Wasserstein barycenter estimation and OT interpolation. By lending scalability and interpretability to OT approaches, Wasserstein Wormhole unlocks new avenues for data analysis in the fields of computational geometry and single-cell biology.",

Analyzing functional brain networks through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is crucial for understanding mental disorder behaviors. Although existing fMRI-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in brain network feature extraction, they often fail to characterize complex relationships between brain regions and demographic information in mental disorders. To overcome these limitations, we propose a learnable NeuroTree framework that integrates a $k$-hop AGE-GCN with neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and contrastive masked functional connectivity (CMFC) to enhance similarities and dissimilarities of brain region distance. Furthermore, NeuroTree effectively decodes fMRI network features into tree structures, which improves the capture of high-order brain regional pathway features and enables the identification of hierarchical neural behavioral patterns essential for understanding disease-related brain subnetworks. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that NeuroTree achieves state-of-the-art performance across two distinct mental disorder datasets. It provides valuable insights into age-related deterioration patterns, elucidating their underlying neural mechanisms.  The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Ding1119/NeuroTree.",

Supervised methods often failed due to the lack of labeled data for predicting the protein-ligand binding energy, like antibodies. Therefore, unsupervised approaches are urged to make full use of the unlabeled data. To tackle the problem, we propose an efficient, unsupervised protein-ligand binding energy prediction model via the conservation of energy (CEBind), which follows the physical laws. Specifically, given a protein-ligand complex, we randomly sample forces for each atom in the ligand. Then these forces are applied rigidly to the ligand to perturb its position, following the law of rigid body dynamics. Finally, CEBind predicts the energy of both the unperturbed complex and the perturbed complex. The energy gap between two complexes equals the work of the outer forces, following the law of conservation of energy. Extensive experiments are conducted on the unsupervised protein-ligand binding energy prediction benchmarks, comparing them with previous works. Empirical results and theoretic analysis demonstrate that CEBind is more efficient and outperforms previous unsupervised models on benchmarks.",

These networks are often trained end-to-end to directly reconstruct an image from a noisy or corrupted measurement of that image. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, training on large and diverse sets of images is considered critical. However, it is often difficult and/or expensive to collect large amounts of training images. Inspired by the success of Data Augmentation (DA) for classification problems, in this paper, we propose a pipeline for data augmentation for accelerated MRI reconstruction and study its effectiveness at reducing the required training data in a variety of settings. Our DA pipeline, MRAugment, is specifically designed to utilize the invariances present in medical imaging measurements as naive DA strategies that neglect the physics of the problem fail. Through extensive studies on multiple datasets we demonstrate that in the low-data regime DA prevents overfitting and can match or even surpass the state of the art while using significantly fewer training data, whereas in the high-data regime it has diminishing returns. Furthermore, our findings show that DA improves the robustness of the model against various shifts in the test distribution.",

However, recent works have raised concerns that deep-learning-based image reconstruction methods are sensitive to perturbations and are less robust than traditional methods: Neural networks (i) may be sensitive to small, yet adversarially-selected perturbations, (ii) may perform poorly under distribution shifts, and (iii) may fail to recover small but important features in an image. In order to understand the sensitivity to such perturbations, in this work, we measure the robustness of different approaches for image reconstruction including trained and un-trained neural networks as well as traditional sparsity-based methods. We find, contrary to prior works, that both trained and un-trained methods are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Moreover, both trained and un-trained methods tuned for a particular dataset suffer very similarly from distribution shifts. Finally, we demonstrate that an image reconstruction method that achieves higher reconstruction quality, also performs better in terms of accurately recovering fine details. Our results indicate that the state-of-the-art deep-learning-based image reconstruction methods provide improved performance than traditional methods without compromising robustness.",

We propose a generative intervention model (GIM) that learns to map these perturbation features to distributions over atomic interventions in a jointly-estimated causal model. Contrary to prior approaches, this enables us to predict the distribution shifts of unseen perturbation features while gaining insights about their mechanistic effects in the underlying data-generating process.

Although genetically engineered lineage-tracing methods have advanced the field, they are either infeasible or ethically constrained in many organisms. By contrast, modern single-cell technologies can measure high-content molecular profiles (*e.g.*, transcriptomes) in a wide range of biological systems. Here, we introduce *CellTreeQM*, a novel deep learning method based on transformer architectures that learns an embedding space with geometric properties optimized for tree-graph inference. By formulating the lineage reconstruction problem as tree-metric learning, we systematically explore weakly supervised training settings at different levels of information and present the *Cell Lineage Reconstruction Benchmark* to facilitate comprehensive evaluation. This benchmark includes (1) synthetic data modeled via Brownian motion with independent noise and spurious signals; (2) lineage-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Experimental results show that *CellTreeQM* recovers lineage structures with minimal supervision and limited data, offering a scalable framework for uncovering cell lineage relationships. To our knowledge, this is the first method to cast cell lineage inference explicitly as a metric learning task, paving the way for future computational models aimed at uncovering the molecular dynamics of cell lineage.

An example is single-cell RNA sequencing, where existing methods model cellular state transitions as latent space interpolations with variational autoencoders, often assuming linear shifts and Euclidean geometry. However, unless explicitly enforced, linear interpolations in the latent space may not correspond to geodesic paths on the data manifold, limiting methods that assume Euclidean geometry in the data representations. We introduce FlatVI, a novel training framework that regularises the latent manifold of discrete-likelihood variational autoencoders towards Euclidean geometry, specifically tailored for modelling single-cell count data. By encouraging straight lines in the latent space to approximate geodesic interpolations on the decoded single-cell manifold, FlatVI enhances compatibility with downstream approaches that assume Euclidean latent geometry. Experiments on synthetic data support the theoretical soundness of our approach, while applications to time-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrate improved trajectory reconstruction and manifold interpolation.",

We show that a novel leave-one-out approach for contrastive learning significantly improves downstream task performance compared to representations from standard pairwise contrastive learning. A logistic regression model trained on SleepFM's learned embeddings outperforms an end-to-end trained convolutional neural network (CNN) on sleep stage classification (macro AUROC 0.88 vs 0.72 and macro AUPRC 0.72 vs 0.48) and sleep disordered breathing detection (AUROC 0.85 vs 0.69 and AUPRC 0.77 vs 0.61).

These tasks are frequently affected by environmental noise due to patient movement artifacts and inherent device noise, which pose significant challenges for lightweight models (e.g., deep binary neural networks (DBNNs)) to perform robust inference. A pertinent question arises: can a well-trained DBNN effectively resist environmental noise during inference? In this study, we find that the DBNN's robustness vulnerability comes from the binary weights and scaling factors. Drawing upon theoretical insights, we propose L1-infinite norm constraints for binary weights and scaling factors, which yield a tighter upper bound compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Finally, visualization studies show that our approach introduces minimal noise perturbations at the periphery of the feature maps. Our approach outperforms the SOTA method, as validated by several experiments conducted on the bio-electrical and image classification datasets.

Here, we present *DiMA*, a latent diffusion framework that operates on protein language model representations. Through systematic exploration of architectural choices and diffusion components, we develop a robust methodology that generalizes across multiple protein encoders ranging from 8M to 3B parameters. We demonstrate that our framework achieves consistently high performance across sequence-only (ESM-2, ESMc), dual-decodable (CHEAP), and multimodal (SaProt) representations using the same architecture and training approach. We conduct extensive evaluation of existing methods alongside *DiMA* using multiple metrics across two protein modalities, covering quality, diversity, novelty, and distribution matching of generated proteins. *DiMA* consistently produces novel, high-quality and diverse protein sequences and achieves strong results compared to baselines such as autoregressive, discrete diffusion and flow matching language models. The model demonstrates versatile functionality, supporting conditional generation tasks including protein family-generation, motif scaffolding and infilling, and fold-specific sequence design, despite being trained solely on sequence data. This work provides a universal continuous diffusion framework for protein sequence generation, offering both architectural insights and practical applicability across various protein design scenarios.

We first investigate the feasibility of adding weights to the consistency loss and then we verify the necessity of smoothed weighting schemes. Based on this study, we propose a self-adaptive algorithm, named Smoothed Adaptive Weighting (SAW). SAW is designed to enhance the robustness of SSL by estimating the learning difficulty of each class and synthesizing the weights in the consistency loss based on such estimation.

Currently, training and sampling state-of-the-art diffusion or flow-based models for conformer generation require significant computational resources. In this work, we build upon flow-matching and propose two mechanisms for accelerating training and inference of generative models for 3D molecular conformer generation. For fast training, we introduce the SO(3)-*Averaged Flow* training objective, which leads to faster convergence to better generation quality compared to conditional optimal transport flow or Kabsch-aligned flow. We demonstrate that models trained using SO(3)-*Averaged Flow* can reach state-of-the-art conformer generation quality. For fast inference, we show that the reflow and distillation methods of flow-based models enable few-steps or even one-step molecular conformer generation with high quality. The training techniques proposed in this work show a path towards highly efficient molecular conformer generation with flow-based models.",

However, an understanding of these dynamics has been developed for years in the form of mathematical process simulators. We study how to incorporate this knowledge into the generative process by leveraging a biological simulator for the task of ECG classification.

Given a pair of observational and interventional datasets, the goal is to isolate the subset of observed variables that were the targets of the intervention. Directly applying causal discovery algorithms is challenging: the data may contain thousands of variables with as few as tens of samples per intervention, and biological systems do not adhere to classical causality assumptions. We propose a causality-inspired approach to address this practical setting. First, we infer noisy causal graphs from the observational and interventional data. Then, we learn to map the differences between these graphs, along with additional statistical features, to sets of variables that were intervened upon. Both modules are jointly trained in a supervised framework, on simulated and real data that reflect the nature of biological interventions. This approach consistently outperforms baselines for perturbation modeling on seven single-cell transcriptomics datasets. We also demonstrate significant improvements over current causal discovery methods for predicting soft and hard intervention targets across a variety of synthetic data.",

Graph neural networks (GNNs) and Transformers, which rely on the message-passing scheme, recently dominated this field due to their powerful expressive ability on graph data. Unfortunately, by considering brain network construction using pairwise Pearson\u2019s coefficients between any pairs of ROIs, model analysis and experimental verification reveal that *the message-passing under both GNNs and Transformers can NOT be fully explored and exploited*. Surprisingly, this paper observes the significant performance and efficiency enhancements of the Hadamard product compared to the matrix product, which is the matrix form of message passing, in processing the brain network. Inspired by this finding, a novel Brain Quadratic Network (BQN) is proposed by incorporating quadratic networks, which possess better universal approximation properties. Moreover, theoretical analysis demonstrates that BQN implicitly performs community detection along with representation learning. Extensive evaluations verify the superiority of the proposed BQN compared to the message-passing-based brain network modeling.

We fill this blank by introducing the GlycanAA model for All-Atom-wise Glycan modeling. GlycanAA models a glycan as a heterogeneous graph with monosaccharide nodes representing its global backbone structure and atom nodes representing its local atomic-level structures. Based on such a graph, GlycanAA performs hierarchical message passing to capture from local atomic-level interactions to global monosaccharide-level interactions. To further enhance model capability, we pre-train GlycanAA on a high-quality unlabeled glycan dataset, deriving the PreGlycanAA model. We design a multi-scale mask prediction algorithm to endow the model about different levels of dependencies in a glycan. Extensive benchmark results show the superiority of GlycanAA over existing glycan encoders and verify the further improvements achieved by PreGlycanAA.

In this paper, we converted the VST problem into a convex optimization problem, which can always be efficiently solved, identified the specific structure of the convex problem, which further improved the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and showed that any finite discrete distributions and the discretized version of any continuous distributions from real data can be variance-stabilized in an easy and nonparametric way.

Existing approaches primarily employ reinforcement learning, Markov sampling, or deep generative models guided by Gaussian processes, which can be prohibitively slow when generating molecules with high binding affinity calculated by computationally-expensive physics-based methods. We present Latent Inceptionism on Molecules (LIMO), which significantly accelerates molecule generation with an inceptionism-like technique. LIMO employs a variational autoencoder-generated latent space and property prediction by two neural networks in sequence to enable faster gradient-based reverse-optimization of molecular properties. Comprehensive experiments show that LIMO performs competitively on benchmark tasks and markedly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on the novel task of generating drug-like compounds with high binding affinity, reaching nanomolar range against two protein targets. We corroborate these docking-based results with more accurate molecular dynamics-based calculations of absolute binding free energy and show that one of our generated drug-like compounds has a predicted $K_D$ (a measure of binding affinity) of $6 \\cdot 10^{-14}$ M against the human estrogen receptor, well beyond the affinities of typical early-stage drug candidates and most FDA-approved drugs to their respective targets.

By training a diffusion generative model directly on 3D atomic positions without making assumptions about the explicit structure of molecules (e.g. modeling torsional angles) we are able to radically simplify structure learning, and make it trivial to scale up the model sizes. This model, called Molecular Conformer Fields (MCF), works by parameterizing conformer structures as functions that map elements from a molecular graph directly to their 3D location in space. This formulation allows us to boil down the essence of structure prediction to learning a distribution over functions. Experimental results show that scaling up the model capacity leads to large gains in generalization performance without enforcing inductive biases like rotational equivariance.

Additionally, the existing fragment-based generative models cannot update the fragment vocabulary with goal-aware fragments newly discovered during the generation. To this end, we propose a molecular generative framework for drug discovery, named *Goal-aware fragment Extraction, Assembly, and Modification* (GEAM). GEAM consists of three modules, each responsible for goal-aware fragment extraction, fragment assembly, and fragment modification. The fragment extraction module identifies important fragments contributing to the desired target properties with the information bottleneck principle, thereby constructing an effective goal-aware fragment vocabulary. Moreover, GEAM can explore beyond the initial vocabulary with the fragment modification module, and the exploration is further enhanced through the dynamic goal-aware vocabulary update. We experimentally demonstrate that GEAM effectively discovers drug candidates through the generative cycle of the three modules in various drug discovery tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/SeulLee05/GEAM.",

However, MIL is frequently challenged by the constraints of working with small, weakly-supervised clinical datasets. Unlike fields such as natural language processing and computer vision, which effectively use transfer learning to improve model quality in data-scarce environments, the transferability of MIL models remains largely unexplored. We conduct the first comprehensive investigation into transfer learning capabilities of pretrained MIL models, evaluating 11 MIL models across 19 pretraining tasks spanning tissue subtyping, cancer grading, and molecular subtype prediction. We observe a substantial performance boost with finetuning pretrained models over training from randomly initialized weights, even with domain differences between pretraining and target tasks. Pretraining on pan-cancer datasets enables consistent generalization across organs and task types compared to single-disease pretraining. Remarkably, this pan-cancer pretraining leads to better transfer than that of a state-of-the-art slide-level foundation model, while using only 6.5\\% of the training data. These findings indicate that MIL architectures exhibit robust adaptability, offering insights into the benefits of leveraging pretrained models to enhance performance in computational pathology.",

To facilitate the understanding of neural dynamics, a popular approach is to fit state space models (SSM) to the data and analyze the dynamics of the low-dimensional latent variables. Despite the power of SSM to explain the dynamics of neural circuits, these models have been shown to merely capture statistical associations in the data and cannot be causally interpreted. Therefore, an important research problem is to build models that can predict neural dynamics under causal manipulations. Here, we propose interventional state-space models (iSSM), a class of causal models that can predict neural responses to novel perturbations. We draw on recent advances in causal dynamical systems and present theoretical results for the identifiability of iSSM. In simulations of the motor cortex, we show that iSSM can recover the true latents and the underlying dynamics. In addition, we illustrate two applications of iSSM in biological datasets. First, we applied iSSM to a dataset of calcium recordings from ALM neurons in mice during photostimulation. Second, we applied iSSM to a dataset of electrophysiological recordings from macaque dlPFC during micro-stimulation. In both cases, we show that iSSM outperforms SSM and results in identifiable parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/amin-nejat/issm.",

With extensive research focused on enhancing adversarial robustness through various forms of adversarial training (AT), a notable knowledge gap remains concerning the uncertainty inherent in adversarially trained models. To address this gap, this study investigates the uncertainty of deep learning models by examining the performance of conformal prediction (CP) in the context of standard adversarial attacks within the adversarial defense community. It is first unveiled that existing CP methods do not produce informative prediction sets under the commonly used $l_{\\infty}$-norm bounded attack if the model is not adversarially trained, which underpins the importance of adversarial training for CP. Our paper next demonstrates that the prediction set size (PSS) of CP using adversarially trained models with AT variants is often worse than using standard AT, inspiring us to research into CP-efficient AT for improved PSS. We propose to optimize a Beta-weighting loss with an entropy minimization regularizer during AT to improve CP-efficiency, where the Beta-weighting loss is shown to be an upper bound of PSS at the population level by our theoretical analysis. Moreover, our empirical study on four image classification datasets across three popular AT baselines validates the effectiveness of the proposed Uncertainty-Reducing AT (AT-UR).",

Our analysis suggests that when the infection is highly transmissible, incomplete testing might be sufficient to achieve good out-of-sample prediction error. Guided by this insight, we develop an algorithm that predicts infections, and show that it outperforms baselines on simulated data. We apply our model to data from a large hospital to predict Clostridioides difficile infections; a communicable disease that is characterized by both symptomatically infected and asymptomatic (i.e., untested) carriers.

However, such models are often not useful in practice because even compounds with high docking scores do not consistently show real-world experimental activity. More accurate methods for activity prediction exist, such as molecular dynamics based binding free energy calculations, but they are too computationally expensive to use in a generative model. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Fidelity Latent space Active Learning (MF-LAL), a generative modeling framework that integrates a set of oracles with varying cost-accuracy tradeoffs. Using active learning, we train a surrogate model for each oracle and use these surrogates to guide generation of compounds with high predicted activity. Unlike previous approaches that separately learn the surrogate model and generative model, MF-LAL combines the generative and multi-fidelity surrogate models into a single framework, allowing for more accurate activity prediction and higher quality samples. Our experiments on two disease-relevant proteins show that MF-LAL produces compounds with significantly better binding free energy scores than other single and multi-fidelity approaches (~50% improvement in mean binding free energy score).

While they provide high-quality and diverse samples from empirical distributions, important questions remain on the reliability and trustworthiness of these sampling procedures for their responsible use in critical scenarios. Conformal prediction is a modern tool to construct finite-sample, distribution-free uncertainty guarantees for any black-box predictor. In this work, we focus on image-to-image regression tasks and we present a generalization of the Risk-Controlling Prediction Sets (RCPS) procedure, that we term $K$-RCPS, which allows to $(i)$ provide entrywise calibrated intervals for future samples of any diffusion model, and $(ii)$ control a certain notion of risk with respect to a ground truth image with minimal mean interval length. Differently from existing conformal risk control procedures, ours relies on a novel convex optimization approach that allows for multidimensional risk control while provably minimizing the mean interval length. We illustrate our approach on two real-world image denoising problems: on natural images of faces as well as on computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen, demonstrating state of the art performance.",

Our method combines Gaussian Processes with State Space Models and employs parallel scan inference algorithms, enabling efficient scaling to large datasets while identifying concurrent  communication patterns that evolve over time. This time-varying approach captures how brain region interactions shift dynamically during cognitive processes.

Current data-driven strategies employ one-step retrosynthesis models and search algorithms to predict synthetic routes in a top-bottom manner. Despite their effective performance, these strategies face limitations in the molecule synthetic route generation due to a greedy selection of the next molecule set without any lookahead. Furthermore, existing strategies cannot control the generation of synthetic routes based on possible criteria such as material costs, yields, and step count. In this work, we propose a general and principled framework via conditional residual energy-based models (EBMs), that focus on the quality of the entire synthetic route based on the specific criteria. By incorporating an additional energy-based function into our probabilistic model, our proposed algorithm can enhance the quality of the most probable synthetic routes (with higher probabilities) generated by various strategies in a plug-and-play fashion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can consistently boost performance across various strategies and outperforms previous state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy by a margin of 2.5%.

Besides, 3D structure-based protein graph augmentation remains unexplored, despite proteins inherently exhibiting 3D structures. To bridge this gap, we propose novel biology-aware graph augmentation strategies from the perspective of invariance and integrate them into the protein GCL framework. Specifically, we introduce Functional Community Invariance (FCI)-based graph augmentation, which employs spectral constraints to preserve topology-driven community structures while incorporating residue-level chemical similarity as edge weights to guide edge sampling and maintain functional communities. Furthermore, we propose 3D Protein Structure Invariance (3-PSI)-based graph augmentation, leveraging dihedral angle perturbations and secondary structure rotations to retain critical 3D structural information of proteins while diversifying graph views.\nExtensive experiments on four different protein-related tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed GCL protein representation learning framework.",

Transformer models, originally developed for natural language processing, have demonstrated significant potential in addressing challenges associated with time-series data. These models utilize different tokenization strategies, point-wise, patch-wise, and variate-wise, to represent time-series data, each resulting in different scope of attention maps. Despite the emergence of sophisticated architectures, simpler transformers  consistently outperform their more complex counterparts in widely used benchmarks. This study examines why point-wise transformers are generally less effective, why intra- and inter-variate attention mechanisms yield similar outcomes, and which architectural components drive the success of simpler models. By analyzing mutual information and evaluating models on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that intra-variate dependencies are the primary contributors to prediction performance on benchmarks, while inter-variate dependencies have a minor impact. Additionally, techniques such as Z-score normalization and skip connections are also crucial. However, these results are largely influenced by the self-dependent and stationary nature of benchmark datasets. By validating our findings on real-world healthcare data, we provide insights for designing more effective transformers for practical applications.",

In fields such as healthcare, biology, and finance, specialised and interpretable linear models still hold considerable value. In such domains, labelled data may be scarce or expensive to obtain. Well-specified prior distributions over model parameters can reduce the sample complexity of learning through Bayesian inference; however, eliciting expert priors can be time-consuming. We therefore introduce AutoElicit to extract knowledge from LLMs and construct priors for predictive models. We show these priors are informative and can be refined using natural language. We perform a careful study contrasting AutoElicit with in-context learning and demonstrate how to perform model selection between the two methods. We find that AutoElicit yields priors that can substantially reduce error over uninformative priors, using fewer labels, and consistently outperform in-context learning. We show that AutoElicit saves over 6 months of labelling effort when building a new predictive model for urinary tract infections from sensor recordings of people living with dementia.",

Estimation of optimal decision rules (ODR) has been extensively investigated recently, however, at present, no testing procedure is proposed to verify whether these ODRs are significantly better than the naive decision rule that always assigning individuals to a fixed treatment option. In this paper, we propose a testing procedure for detecting the existence of an ODR that is better than the naive decision rule under the randomized trials. We construct the proposed test based on the difference of estimated value functions using the augmented inverse probability weighted method. The asymptotic distributions of the proposed test statistic under the null and local alternative hypotheses are established. Based on the established asymptotic distributions, we further develop a sample size calculation formula for testing the existence of an ODR in designing A/B tests. Extensive simulations and a real data application to a schizophrenia clinical trial data are conducted to demonstrate the empirical validity of the proposed methods.",

However, the identification of prognostic genes is complicated by the high dimensionality of genetic data, which makes their identification computationally intensive. Furthermore, most cancer genomics studies lack appropriate low-risk groups against which to compare. To address these issues, we present a framework that identifies candidate prognostic genes by integrating representation learning and statistical analysis approaches. Specifically, we propose a collaborative filtering-derived mechanism to represent patients in order of their survival risk, facilitating their dichotomization. We also propose a mechanism that allows embedded gene vectors to be polarized on the extremities of, or centered on, both reference axes to facilitate recommendations. Restricting our analysis to a few representative genes within each cluster allowed for the efficient identification of prognostic genes. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of this proposed framework for identifying prognostic genes.",

While the literature attributes shortcuts to biases in superficial features, we show that imbalances in the semantic distribution of sample embeddings induce spurious semantic correlations, compromising model robustness. To address this issue, we propose SCISSOR (Semantic Cluster Intervention for Suppressing ShORtcut), a Siamese network-based debiasing approach that remaps the semantic space by discouraging latent clusters exploited as shortcuts. Unlike prior data-debiasing approaches, SCISSOR eliminates the need for data augmentation and rewriting. \nWe evaluate SCISSOR on 6 models across 4 benchmarks: Chest-XRay and Not-MNIST in computer vision, and GYAFC and Yelp in NLP tasks. Compared to several baselines, SCISSOR reports +5.3 absolute points in F1 score on GYAFC, +7.3 on Yelp, +7.7 on Chest-XRay, and +1 on Not-MNIST. SCISSOR is also highly advantageous for lightweight models with \u223c9.5% improvement on F1 for ViT on computer vision datasets and \u223c11.9% for BERT on NLP.

Building on this innovative perspective, we introduce RFold, a simple yet effective method that learns to predict the most matching K-Rook solution from the given sequence. RFold employs a bi-dimensional optimization strategy that decomposes the probabilistic matching problem into row-wise and column-wise components to reduce the matching complexity, simplifying the solving process while guaranteeing the validity of the output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFold achieves competitive performance and about eight times faster inference efficiency than the state-of-the-art approaches.

Backmapping is the opposite operation of bringing lost atomistic details back from the CG representation. While machine learning (ML) has produced accurate and efficient CG simulations of proteins, fast and reliable backmapping remains a challenge. Rule-based methods produce poor all-atom geometries, needing computationally costly refinement through additional simulations. Recently proposed ML approaches outperform traditional baselines but are not transferable between proteins and sometimes generate unphysical atom placements with steric clashes and implausible torsion angles. This work addresses both issues to build a fast, transferable, and reliable generative backmapping tool for CG protein representations. We achieve generalization and reliability through a combined set of innovations: representation based on internal coordinates; an equivariant encoder/prior; a custom loss function that helps ensure local structure, global structure, and physical constraints; and expert curation of high-quality out-of-equilibrium protein data for training. Our results pave the way for out-of-the-box backmapping of coarse-grained simulations for arbitrary proteins.",

Geneticists use this data to build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models to optimize likelihood. Surprisingly, we find that larger models only improve performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions, potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target identification.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting of Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) is critical for numerous areas, such as healthcare, biomechanics, climate science, and astronomy. Despite existing research addressing irregularities in time series through ordinary differential equations, the challenge of modeling correlations between asynchronous IMTS remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this study proposes Transformable Patching Graph Neural Networks (t-PatchGNN), which transforms each univariate irregular time series into a series of transformable patches encompassing a varying number of observations with uniform temporal resolution. It seamlessly facilitates local semantics capture and inter-time series correlation modeling while avoiding sequence length explosion in aligned IMTS. Building on the aligned patching outcomes, we then present time-adaptive graph neural networks to model dynamic intertime series correlation based on a series of learned time-varying adaptive graphs. We demonstrate the remarkable superiority of t-PatchGNN on a comprehensive IMTS forecasting benchmark we build, which contains four real-world scientific datasets covering healthcare, biomechanics and climate science, and seventeen competitive baselines adapted from relevant research fields.",

We prove that the optimal variational distribution, which perfectly bounds the log-likelihood, may depend on the censoring mechanism.

Because of patient heterogeneity, each patient requires a unique stimulation policy to achieve optimal neural responses. Model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) holds promise in learning effective policies for a variety of similar control tasks, but is limited in domains like brain stimulation by a need for numerous costly environment interactions. In this work we introduce Coprocessor Actor Critic, a novel, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach for learning neural coprocessor policies for brain stimulation. Our key insight is that coprocessor policy learning is a combination of learning how to act optimally in the world and learning how to induce optimal actions in the world through stimulation of an injured brain. We show that our approach overcomes the limitations of traditional MFRL methods in terms of sample efficiency and task success and outperforms baseline MBRL approaches in a neurologically realistic model of an injured brain.",

We advocate for this approach due to its efficient encoding of graphs and propose a novel representation. Based on this representation, we introduce the Graph Generative Pre-trained Transformer (G2PT), an auto-regressive model that learns graph structures via next-token prediction. To further exploit G2PT's capabilities as a general-purpose foundation model, we explore fine-tuning strategies for two downstream applications: goal-oriented generation and graph property prediction.

This type of adaptive clinical trial has been thoroughly studied in biostatistics, but has been allowed only limited adaptivity so far. Here, we aim to relax classical restrictions on such designs and investigate how to incorporate ideas from the recent machine learning literature on adaptive and online experimentation to make trials more flexible and efficient. We find that the unique characteristics of the subpopulation selection problem -- most importantly that (i) one is usually interested in finding subpopulations with any treatment benefit (and not necessarily the single subgroup with largest effect) given a limited budget and that (ii) effectiveness only has to be demonstrated across the subpopulation on average -- give rise to interesting challenges and new desiderata when designing algorithmic solutions. Building on these findings, we propose AdaGGI and AdaGCPI, two meta-algorithms for subpopulation construction. We empirically investigate their performance across a range of simulation scenarios and derive insights into their (dis)advantages across different settings.",

We study conformal prediction with missing values in the covariates -- a setting that brings new challenges to uncertainty quantification. We first show that the marginal coverage guarantee of conformal prediction holds on imputed data for any missingness distribution and almost all imputation functions. However, we emphasize that the average coverage varies depending on the pattern of missing values: conformal methods tend to construct prediction intervals that under-cover the response conditionally to some missing patterns. This motivates our novel generalized conformalized quantile regression framework, missing data augmentation, which yields prediction intervals that are valid conditionally to the patterns of missing values, despite their exponential number. We then show that a universally consistent quantile regression algorithm trained on the imputed data is Bayes optimal for the pinball risk, thus achieving valid coverage conditionally to any given data point. Moreover, we examine the case of a linear model, which demonstrates the importance of our proposal in overcoming the heteroskedasticity induced by missing values. Using synthetic and data from critical care, we corroborate our theory and report improved performance of our methods.",

However, training is resource-intensive for edge devices, and limited network bandwidth is often the main bottleneck. Prior work often overcomes the constraints by condensing the models or messages into compact formats, e.g., by gradient compression or distillation. In contrast, we propose ProgFed, the first progressive training framework for efficient and effective federated learning. It inherently reduces computation and two-way communication costs while maintaining the strong performance of the final models. We theoretically prove that ProgFed converges at the same asymptotic rate as standard training on full models. Extensive results on a broad range of architectures, including CNNs (VGG, ResNet, ConvNets) and U-nets, and diverse tasks from simple classification to medical image segmentation show that our highly effective training approach saves up to $20%$ computation and up to $63%$ communication costs for converged models. As our approach is also complimentary to prior work on compression, we can achieve a wide range of trade-offs by combining these techniques, showing reduced communication of up to $50\\times$ at only $0.1%$ loss in utility.

The Time Series Deconfounder uses a novel recurrent neural network architecture with multitask output to build a factor model over time and infer latent variables that render the assigned treatments conditionally independent; then, it performs causal inference using these latent variables that act as substitutes for the multi-cause unobserved confounders.

The framework includes the canonical drift-diffusion model and enables extensions such as multi-dimensional accumulators, variable and collapsing boundaries, and discrete jumps. Our framework is based on constraining the parameters of recurrent state space models, for which we introduce a scalable variational Laplace EM inference algorithm. We applied the modeling approach to spiking responses recorded from monkey parietal cortex during two decision-making tasks. We found that a two-dimensional accumulator better captured the responses of a set of parietal neurons than a single accumulator model, and we identified a variable lower boundary in the responses of a parietal neuron during a random dot motion task.

This work proposes a theoretically grounded, memory-efficient technique to calculate *voxel-wise variance* for quantifying uncertainty due to acquisition noise in accelerated MRI reconstructions. Our approach is based on approximating the noise covariance using the DL network's Jacobian, which is intractable to calculate. To circumvent this, we derive an *unbiased estimator* for the diagonal of this covariance matrix\u2014voxel-wise variance\u2014, and introduce a Jacobian sketching technique to efficiently implement it. We evaluate our method on knee and brain MRI datasets for both data-driven and physics-driven networks trained in supervised and unsupervised manners. Compared to empirical references obtained via Monte-Carlo simulations, our technique achieves near-equivalent performance while reducing computational and memory demands by an order of magnitude or more. Furthermore, our method is robust across varying input noise levels, acceleration factors, and diverse undersampling schemes, highlighting its broad applicability.

To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation method that uses existing enzyme-substrate data to guide enzyme design. Our method retrieves enzymes with substrates that share structural similarities with the target molecule, leveraging functional similarities in catalytic activity. Since none of the retrieved enzymes directly catalyze the target molecule, we use a conditioned discrete diffusion model to generate new enzymes based on the retrieved examples. An enzyme-substrate relationship classifier guides the generation process to ensure optimal protein sequence distributions. We evaluate our model on enzyme design tasks with diverse real-world substrates and show that it outperforms existing protein generation methods in catalytic capability, foldability, and docking accuracy.

    "abstract": "Discovering reliable and informative relationships among brain regions from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals is essential in phenotypic predictions in neuroscience. Most of the current methods fail to accurately characterize those interactions because they only focus on pairwise connections and overlook the high-order relationships of brain regions. We propose that these high-order relationships should be *maximally informative and minimally redundant* (MIMR). However, identifying such high-order relationships is challenging and under-explored due to the exponential search space and the absence of a tractable objective. In response to this gap, we propose a novel method named HyBRiD, which aims to extract MIMR high-order relationships from fMRI data. HyBRiD employs a Constructor to identify hyperedge structures, and a Weighter to compute a weight for each hyperedge, which avoids searching in exponential space. HyBRiD achieves the MIMR objective through an innovative information bottleneck framework named multi-head drop-bottleneck with theoretical guarantees. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art predictive model by an average of 11.2%, regarding the quality of hyperedges measured by CPM, a standard protocol for studying brain connections.",

Naturally, molecules can be represented as 2D topological graphs or 3D geometric point clouds. Although most existing pertaining methods focus on merely the single modality, recent research has shown that maximizing the mutual information (MI) between such two modalities enhances the molecule representation ability. Meanwhile, existing molecule multi-modal pretraining approaches approximate MI based on the representation space encoded from the topology and geometry, thus resulting in the loss of critical structural information of molecules. To address this issue, we propose MoleculeSDE. MoleculeSDE leverages group symmetric (e.g., SE(3)-equivariant and reflection-antisymmetric) stochastic differential equation models to generate the 3D geometries from 2D topologies, and vice versa, directly in the input space. It not only obtains tighter MI bound but also enables prosperous downstream tasks than the previous work. By comparing with 17 pretraining baselines, we empirically verify that MoleculeSDE can learn an expressive representation with state-of-the-art performance on 26 out of 32 downstream tasks.",

To fill these gaps, we introduce an under-explored task, named flexible docking to predict poses of ligand and pocket sidechains simultaneously and introduce Re-Dock, a novel diffusion bridge generative model extended to geometric manifolds. Specifically, we propose energy-to-geometry mapping inspired by the Newton-Euler equation to co-model the binding energy and conformations for reflecting the energy-constrained docking generative process.

We present two variants: $\\texttt{mCS-dist}$, using distance-based scores, and $\\texttt{mCS-learn}$, which learns optimal scores via differentiable optimization.

A two-step process of discovering ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and their subsequent mathematical analysis can yield insights into the system's dynamics. However, this analysis may be infeasible for complex equations, and refining the ODE to meet certain behavioral requirements can be challenging. Direct semantic modeling has recently been proposed to address these issues by predicting the system's behavior, such as the trajectory's shape, directly from data, bypassing post-hoc mathematical analysis. In this work, we extend the original instantiation, limited to one-dimensional trajectories and inputs, to accommodate multi-dimensional trajectories with additional personalization, allowing evolution to depend on auxiliary static features (e.g., patient covariates). In a series of experiments, we show how our approach enables practitioners to integrate prior knowledge, understand the dynamics, ensure desired behaviors, and revise the model when necessary.",

With the advancement of machine learning, computer-aided synthesis planning has gained increasing interest. Numerous methods were proposed to solve this problem with different levels of dependency on additional chemical knowledge. In this paper, we propose Retroformer, a novel Transformer-based architecture for retrosynthesis prediction without relying on any cheminformatics tools for molecule editing. Via the proposed local attention head, the model can jointly encode the molecular sequence and graph, and efficiently exchange information between the local reactive region and the global reaction context. Retroformer reaches the new state-of-the-art accuracy for the end-to-end template-free retrosynthesis, and improves over many strong baselines on better molecule and reaction validity. In addition, its generative procedure is highly interpretable and controllable. Overall, Retroformer pushes the limits of the reaction reasoning ability of deep generative models.",

A key approach to capture this complexity is to uncover fundamental interpretable units within the data, Building Blocks (BBs), which modulate their activity and adjust their structure across observations. Existing methods for identifying BBs in multi-way data often overlook inter- vs. intra-state variability, produce uninterpretable components, or do not align with properties of real-world data, such as missing samples and sessions of different duration. Here, we present a framework for Similarity-driven Building Block Inference using Graphs across States (SiBBlInGS). SiBBlInGS offers a graph-based dictionary learning approach for discovering sparse BBs along with their temporal traces, based on co-activity patterns and inter- vs. intra-state relationships. Moreover, SiBBlInGS captures per-trial temporal variability and controlled cross-state structural BB adaptations, identifies state-specific vs. state-invariant components, and accommodates variability in the number and duration of observed sessions across states. We demonstrate SiBBlInGS's ability to reveal insights into complex phenomena as well as its robustness to noise and missing samples through several synthetic and real-world examples, including web search and neural data.",

These regimes are particularly effective for managing chronic disorders and is arguably one of the critical ingredients underlying more personalized decision-making systems. All reinforcement learning algorithms for finding the optimal DTR in online settings will suffer O(\\sqrt{|D_{X, S}|T}) regret on some environments, where T is the number of experiments, and D_{X, S} is the domains of treatments X and covariates S. This implies T = O (|D_{X, S}|) trials to generate an optimal DTR. In many applications, domains of X and S could be so enormous that the time required to ensure appropriate learning may be unattainable. We show that, if the causal diagram of the underlying environment is provided, one could achieve regret that is exponentially smaller than D_{X, S}. In particular, we develop two online algorithms that satisfy such regret bounds by exploiting the causal structure underlying the DTR; one is based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU-DTR), and the other uses the posterior sampling learning (PS-DTR). Finally, we introduce efficient methods to accelerate these online learning procedures by leveraging the abundant, yet biased observational (non-experimental) data.",

The cost and latency of wet-lab experiments requires methods that find good sequences in few experimental rounds of large batches of sequences \u2014 a setting that off-the-shelf black-box optimization methods are ill-equipped to handle. We find that the performance of existing methods varies drastically across optimization tasks, posing a significant obstacle to real-world applications. To improve robustness, we propose Population-Based Black-Box Optimization (P3BO), which generates batches of sequences by sampling from an ensemble of methods. The number of sequences sampled from any method is proportional to the quality of sequences it previously proposed, allowing P3BO to combine the strengths of individual methods while hedging against their innate brittleness. Adapting the hyper-parameters of each of the methods online using evolutionary optimization further improves performance. Through extensive experiments on in-silico optimization tasks, we show that P3BO outperforms any single method in its population, proposing higher quality sequences as well as more diverse batches. As such, P3BO and Adaptive-P3BO are a crucial step towards deploying ML to real-world sequence design.",

Promising empirical results revealed that a strong model can surpass its weak supervisor. While recent work has offered theoretical insights into this phenomenon, a clear understanding of the interactions between weak and strong models that drive W2SG remains elusive. We investigate W2SG through a theoretical lens and show that it can be characterized using kernels derived from the principal components of weak and strong models' internal representations. These kernels can be used to define a space that, at a high level, captures what the weak model is unable to learn but is learnable by the strong model. The projection of labels onto this space quantifies how much the strong model falls short of its full potential due to weak supervision. This characterization also provides insights into how certain errors in weak supervision can be corrected by the strong model, regardless of overfitting. Our theory has significant practical implications, providing a representation-based metric that predicts W2SG performance trends without requiring labels, as shown in experiments on molecular predictions with transformers and 5 NLP tasks involving 52 LLMs.",

To reduce the time between symptoms onset and treatment, wearable ECG sensors were developed to allow for the recording of the full 12-lead ECG signal at home. However, if even a single lead is not correctly positioned on the body that lead becomes corrupted, making automatic diagnosis on the basis of the full signal impossible. In this work, we present a methodology to reconstruct missing or noisy leads using the theory of Koopman Operators. Given a dataset consisting of full 12-lead ECGs, we learn a dynamical system describing the evolution of the 12 individual signals together in time. The Koopman theory indicates that there exists a high-dimensional embedding space in which the operator which propagates from one time instant to the next is linear. We therefore learn both the mapping to this embedding space, as well as the corresponding linear operator. Armed with this representation, we are able to impute missing leads by solving a least squares system in the embedding space, which can be achieved efficiently due to the sparse structure of the system. We perform an empirical evaluation using 12-lead ECG signals from thousands of patients, and show that we are able to reconstruct the signals in such way that enables accurate clinical diagnosis.",

Specifically, FILM generates semantic prompts from images and inputs them into ChatGPT for comprehensive textual descriptions. These descriptions are fused within the textual domain and guide the visual information fusion, enhancing feature extraction and contextual understanding, directed by textual semantic information via cross-attention. FILM has shown promising results in four image fusion tasks: infrared-visible, medical, multi-exposure, and multi-focus image fusion.

In this paper, we propose EnzyGen, an approach to learn a unified model to design enzymes across all functional families. Our key idea is to generate an enzyme's amino acid sequence and their three-dimensional (3D) coordinates based on functionally important sites and substrates corresponding to a desired catalytic function. These sites are automatically mined from enzyme databases. EnzyGen consists of a novel interleaving network of attention and neighborhood equivariant layers, which captures both long-range correlation in an entire protein sequence and local influence from nearest amino acids in 3D space. To learn the generative model, we devise a joint training objective, including a sequence generation loss, a position prediction loss and an enzyme-substrate interaction loss. We further construct EnzyBench, a dataset with 3157 enzyme families, covering all available enzymes within the protein data bank (PDB). Experimental results show that our EnzyGen consistently achieves the best performance across all 323 testing families, surpassing the best baseline by 10.79% in terms of substrate binding affinity. These findings demonstrate EnzyGen's superior capability in designing well-folded and effective enzymes binding to specific substrates with high affinities.

We study one such problem setting, that of ``one-sided'' matrix completion, where our goal is to recover the right singular vectors of $X$, even in the regime where recovering the left singular vectors is impossible, which arises when there are more rows than columns and very few observations. We propose a natural algorithm that involves imputing the missing values of the matrix $X^TX$ and show that even with only two observations per row in $X$, we can provably recover $X^TX$ as long as we have at least $\\Omega(r^2 d \\log d)$ rows, where $r$ is the rank and $d$ is the number of columns. We evaluate our algorithm on one-sided recovery of synthetic data and low-coverage genome sequencing.

In this paper, we propose a novel cell instance segmentation method inspired by the four-color theorem. By conceptualizing cells as countries and tissues as oceans, we introduce a four-color encoding scheme that ensures adjacent instances receive distinct labels. This reformulation transforms instance segmentation into a constrained semantic segmentation problem with only four predicted classes, substantially simplifying the instance differentiation process. To solve the training instability caused by the non-uniqueness of four-color encoding, we design an asymptotic training strategy and encoding transformation method.

To address these obstacles, we propose D-BETA, a novel framework that pre-trains ECG and text data using a contrastive masked auto-encoder architecture, uniquely combining generative and boosted discriminative capabilities for robust cross-modal representations. This is accomplished through masked modality modeling, specialized loss functions, and an improved negative sampling strategy tailored for cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on five public datasets across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that D-BETA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving an average AUC improvement of 15% in linear probing with only one percent of training data and 2% in zero-shot performance without requiring training data over state-of-the-art models.

However, each individual cell cannot be tracked longitudinally, and cells at the same point in real time may be at different stages of the transition process. This can be viewed as a problem of learning the behavior of a dynamical system from observations whose times are unknown. Additionally, a single progenitor cell type often bifurcates into multiple child cell types, further complicating the problem of modeling the dynamics. To address this problem, we developed an approach called variational mixtures of ordinary differential equations. By using a simple family of ODEs informed by the biochemistry of gene expression to constrain the likelihood of a deep generative model, we can simultaneously infer the latent time and latent state of each cell and predict its future gene expression state. The model can be interpreted as a mixture of ODEs whose parameters vary continuously across a latent space of cell states. Our approach dramatically improves data fit, latent time inference, and future cell state estimation of single-cell gene expression data compared to previous approaches.",

    "abstract": "The recent availability of Electronic Health Records (EHR) has allowed for the development of algorithms predicting inpatient risk of deterioration and trajectory evolution. However, prediction of disease progression with EHR is challenging since these data are sparse, heterogeneous, multi-dimensional, and multi-modal time-series. As such, clustering is regularly used to identify similar groups within the patient cohort to improve prediction. Current models have shown some success in obtaining cluster representations of patient trajectories. However, they i) fail to obtain clinical interpretability for each cluster, and ii) struggle to learn meaningful cluster numbers in the context of imbalanced distribution of disease outcomes. We propose a supervised deep learning model to cluster EHR data based on the identification of clinically understandable phenotypes with regard to both outcome prediction and patient trajectory. We introduce novel loss functions to address the problems of class imbalance and cluster collapse, and furthermore propose a feature-time attention mechanism to identify cluster-based phenotype importance across time and feature dimensions. We tested our model in two datasets corresponding to distinct medical settings. Our model yielded added interpretability to cluster formation and outperformed benchmarks by at least 4% in relevant metrics.",

Domain Generalization (DG) methods overcome this either through representation learning or data augmentation (DA). While representation learning methods seek domain-invariant features, they often rely on ad-hoc techniques and lack formal guarantees.

We propose LangDAug, a novel **Lang**evin **D**ata **Aug**mentation for multi-source domain generalization in 2D medical image segmentation. LangDAug leverages Energy-Based Models (EBMs) trained via contrastive divergence to traverse between source domains, generating intermediate samples through Langevin dynamics. Theoretical analysis shows that LangDAug induces a regularization effect, and for GLMs, it upper-bounds the Rademacher complexity by the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold. Through extensive experiments on Fundus segmentation and 2D MRI prostate segmentation benchmarks, we show that LangDAug outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization methods and effectively complements existing domain-randomization approaches.

Recent advances in machine-learning-guided approaches focus on building a surrogate sequence-function model to reduce the burden of expensive in-lab experiments. In this paper, we study the exploration mechanism of model-guided sequence design. We leverage a natural property of protein fitness landscape that a concise set of mutations upon the wild-type sequence are usually sufficient to enhance the desired function. By utilizing this property, we propose Proximal Exploration (PEX) algorithm that prioritizes the evolutionary search for high-fitness mutants with low mutation counts. In addition, we develop a specialized model architecture, called Mutation Factorization Network (MuFacNet), to predict low-order mutational effects, which further improves the sample efficiency of model-guided evolution.

To address these drawbacks, we propose InfoOT, an information-theoretic extension of optimal transport that maximizes the mutual information between domains while minimizing geometric distances. The resulting objective can still be formulated as a (generalized) optimal transport problem, and can be efficiently solved by projected gradient descent. This formulation yields a new projection method that is robust to outliers and generalizes to unseen samples.

In this work, we model bacterial communities directly from their genomes using graph neural networks (GNNs).

We propose to learn the dynamics implicitly by directly predicting community relative abundance profiles at steady state, thus escaping the need for growth curves. On two real-world datasets, we show for the first time generalization to unseen bacteria and different community structures. To investigate the prediction results more deeply, we create a simulation for flexible data generation and analyze effects of bacteria interaction strength, community size, and training data amount.",

Despite the rapid advance of many CD understanding tasks in respective branches, the isolated evolution leads to their limited cross-domain generalisation and repetitive technique innovation. Since there is a strong coupling relationship between foreground and background context in CD tasks, existing methods require to train separate models in their focused domains. This restricts their real-world CD concept understanding towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). We propose a unified model with a single set of parameters, Spider, which only needs to be trained once. With the help of the proposed concept filter driven by the image-mask group prompt, Spider is able to understand and distinguish diverse strong context-dependent concepts to accurately capture the Prompter's intention. Without bells and whistles, Spider significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art specialized models in 8 different context-dependent segmentation tasks, including 4 natural scenes (salient, camouflaged, and transparent objects and shadow) and 4 medical lesions (COVID-19, polyp, breast, and skin lesion with color colonoscopy, CT, ultrasound, and dermoscopy modalities). Besides, Spider shows obvious advantages in continuous learning. It can easily complete the training of new tasks by fine-tuning parameters less than 1% and bring a tolerable performance degradation of less than 5% for all old tasks.

Bayesian inference provides a mathematical framework for systematically selecting model components, but defining prior distributions over model components and developing associated inference schemes has been challenging. We approach this problem in a simulation-based inference framework: We define model priors over candidate components and, from model simulations, train neural networks to infer joint probability distributions over both model components and associated parameters. Our method, simulation-based model inference (SBMI), represents distributions over model components as a conditional mixture of multivariate binary distributions in the Grassmann formalism. SBMI can be applied to any compositional stochastic simulator without requiring likelihood evaluations. We evaluate SBMI on a simple time series model and on two scientific models from neuroscience, and show that it can discover multiple data-consistent model configurations, and that it reveals non-identifiable model components and parameters. SBMI provides a powerful tool for data-driven scientific inquiry which will allow scientists to identify essential model components and make uncertainty-informed modelling decisions.",

Complementary to the RD, the Risk Ratio (RR), as a relative measure, is critical for a comprehensive understanding of intervention effects: RD can downplay small absolute changes, while RR can highlight them. Despite its significance, the theoretical study of RR has received less attention, particularly in observational settings. This paper addresses this gap by tackling the estimation of RR in observational data. We propose several RR estimators and establish their theoretical properties, including asymptotic normality and confidence intervals. Through analyses on simulated and real-world datasets, we evaluate the performance of these estimators in terms of bias, efficiency, and robustness to generative data models. We also examine the coverage and length of the associated confidence intervals. Due to the non-linear nature of RR, influence function theory yields two distinct efficient estimators with different convergence assumptions. Based on theoretical and empirical insights, we recommend, among all estimators, one of the two doubly-robust estimators, which, intriguingly, challenges conventional expectations.",

The typical component of UNet family is the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures, making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks.

In spite of tremendous success in the experimental neuroscience field, a system-level understanding of how brain anatomy supports various neural activities remains elusive. Capitalizing on the unprecedented amount of neuroimaging data, we present a physics-informed deep model to uncover the coupling mechanism between brain structure and function through the lens of data geometry that is rooted in the widespread wiring topology of connections between distant brain regions. Since deciphering the puzzle of self-organized patterns in functional fluctuations is the gateway to understanding the emergence of cognition and behavior, we devise a geometric deep model to uncover manifold mapping functions that characterize the intrinsic feature representations of evolving functional fluctuations on the Riemannian manifold. In lieu of learning unconstrained mapping functions, we introduce a set of graph-harmonic scattering transforms to impose the brain-wide geometry on top of manifold mapping functions, which allows us to cast the manifold-based deep learning into a reminiscent of *MLP-Mixer* architecture (in computer vision) for Riemannian manifold. As a proof-of-concept approach, we explore a neural-manifold perspective to understand the relationship between (static) brain structure and (dynamic) function, challenging the prevailing notion in cognitive neuroscience by proposing that neural activities are essentially excited by brain-wide oscillation waves living on the geometry of human connectomes, instead of being confined to focal areas.",

We present LM-Design, a generic approach to reprogramming sequence-based protein language models (pLMs), that have learned massive sequential evolutionary knowledge from the universe of natural protein sequences, to acquire an immediate capability to design preferable protein sequences for given folds. We conduct a structural surgery on pLMs, where a lightweight structural adapter is implanted into pLMs and endows it with structural awareness. During inference, iterative refinement is performed to effectively optimize the generated protein sequences. Experiments show that LM-Design improves the state-of-the-art results by a large margin, leading to 4% to 12% accuracy gains in sequence recovery (e.g., 55.65%/56.63% on CATH 4.2/4.3 single-chain benchmarks, and >60% when designing protein complexes). We provide extensive and in-depth analyses, which verify that LM-Design can (1) indeed leverage both structural and sequential knowledge to accurately handle structurally non-deterministic regions, (2) benefit from scaling data and model size, and (3) generalize to other proteins (e.g., antibodies and de novo proteins).",

    "abstract": "Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a vital role in monitoring cardiac health and diagnosing heart diseases. However, traditional deep learning approaches for ECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both time-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling the extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently transferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored SSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail to capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals. As a result, these methods struggle to learn generalized representations due to their inability to model the hierarchical structure of ECG data. To address this gap, we introduce MELP, a novel Multi-scale ECG-Language Pretraining (MELP) model that fully leverages hierarchical supervision from ECG-text pairs. MELP first pretrains a cardiology-specific language model to enhance its understanding of clinical text. It then applies three levels of cross-modal supervision\u2014at the token, beat, and rhythm levels\u2014to align ECG signals with textual reports, capturing structured information across different time scales. We evaluate MELP on three public ECG datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot ECG classification, linear probing, and transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that MELP outperforms existing SSL methods, underscoring its effectiveness and adaptability across diverse clinical applications.

Despite their predictive power, these models often suffer from limited interpretability, raising concerns for scientific applications that require reliable and transparent insights. While existing methods have primarily focused on explaining molecular substructures in 2D GNNs, the transition to 3D GNNs introduces unique challenges, such as handling the implicit dense edge structures created by a cutoff radius. To tackle this, we introduce a novel explanation method specifically designed for 3D GNNs, which localizes the explanation to the immediate neighborhood of each node within the 3D space. Each node is assigned an radius of influence, defining the localized region within which message passing captures spatial and structural interactions crucial for the model's predictions. This method leverages the spatial and geometric characteristics inherent in 3D graphs. By constraining the subgraph to a localized radius of influence, the approach not only enhances interpretability but also aligns with the physical and structural dependencies typical of 3D graph applications, such as molecular learning.",

In such cases where the graph is a discretization of an underlying Riemannian closed manifold, we prove that Diffusion EMD is topologically equivalent to the standard EMD with a geodesic ground distance. Diffusion EMD can be computed in {\u00d5}(n) time and is more accurate than similarly fast algorithms such as tree-based EMDs. We also show Diffusion EMD is fully differentiable, making it amenable to future uses in gradient-descent frameworks such as deep neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate an application of Diffusion EMD to single cell data collected from 210 COVID-19 patient samples at Yale New Haven Hospital. Here, Diffusion EMD can derive distances between patients on the manifold of cells at least two orders of magnitude faster than equally accurate methods. This distance matrix between patients can be embedded into a higher level patient manifold which uncovers structure and heterogeneity in patients. More generally, Diffusion EMD is applicable to all datasets that are massively collected in parallel in many medical and biological systems.",

In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties.

Our approach utilizes a transformer architecture with heterogeneous type embedding trained using temporal-difference learning. After obtaining an initial estimate using the transformer, following the targeted minimum loss-based likelihood estimation (TMLE) framework, we statistically corrected for the bias commonly associated with machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, our method also facilitates statistical inference by enabling the provision of 95% confidence intervals grounded in asymptotic statistical theory. Simulation results demonstrate our method's superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in complex, long time-horizon scenarios. It remains effective in small-sample, short-duration contexts, matching the performance of asymptotically efficient estimators. To demonstrate our method in practice, we applied our method to estimate counterfactual mean outcomes for standard versus intensive blood pressure management strategies in a real-world cardiovascular epidemiology cohort study.",

Expressive deep learning (DL) models have gained popularity for dimensionality reduction, but the resulting latent space often remains difficult to interpret. In this work we propose SOM-CPC, a model that visualizes data in an organized 2D manifold, while preserving higher-dimensional information. We address a largely unexplored and challenging set of scenarios comprising high-rate time series, and show on both synthetic and real-life data (physiological data and audio recordings) that SOM-CPC outperforms strong baselines like DL-based feature extraction, followed by conventional dimensionality reduction techniques, and models that jointly optimize a DL model and a Self-Organizing Map (SOM).

In response, we propose a transfer-learning approach that leverages advances in protein sequence modeling and folding stability prediction for this task. The key idea is to parameterize the binding energy as the difference between the folding energy of the protein complex and the sum of the folding energies of its binding partners. We show that using a pre-trained inverse-folding model as a proxy for folding energy provides strong zero-shot performance, and can be fine-tuned with (1) copious folding energy measurements and (2) more limited binding energy measurements.\nThe resulting predictor, StaB-ddG, is the first deep learning predictor to match the accuracy of the state-of-the-art empirical force-field method Flex ddG, while offering an over 10,000x speed-up.",

However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter factuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize textual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict information in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately addressed clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. In response, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising, disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual tools, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial improvements over existing preference optimization methods by 14.2% and 51.7% on the Med-VQA and report generation tasks, respectively.

To handle arbitrary observation patterns, we interpret the data as samples from an underlying continuous-time process and propose to model its latent trajectory explicitly using the mathematics of controlled differential equations. This leads to a new approach, the Treatment Effect Neural Controlled Differential Equation (TE-CDE), that allows the potential outcomes to be evaluated at any time point. In addition, adversarial training is used to adjust for time-dependent confounding which is critical in longitudinal settings and is an added challenge not encountered in conventional time series. To assess solutions to this problem, we propose a controllable simulation environment based on a model of tumor growth for a range of scenarios with irregular sampling reflective of a variety of clinical scenarios.

However, no matter the size of LLMs, certain problems cannot be resolved in a single forward pass. Meanwhile, agent-based reasoning systems require access to a comprehensive nonparametric knowledge base, which is often costly or not feasible for use in scientific and niche domains. We present Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE), a novel reasoning method that merges parametric and non-parametric memories to improve accurate reasoning with minimal external input. GIVE guides the LLM agent to select the most pertinent expert data ($\\textbf{observe}$), engage in query-specific associative thinking ($\\textbf{reflect}$), and then synthesize this information to produce the final output ($\\textbf{speak}$). Extensive experiments demonstrated the following benefits of our framework: (1) GIVE increases the performance of LLMs across various sizes. (2) In some scenarios, GIVE allows smaller LLMs to surpass larger, more sophisticated ones in scientific tasks ($\\textbf{GPT3.5T + GIVE > GPT4}$). (3) GIVE is effective on scientific and open-domain assessments. (4) GIVE is a training-free method that enables LLMs to tackle new problems that extend beyond their training data (up to $\\textbf{43.5}$\\% $\\rightarrow$ $\\textbf{88.2}$\\% accuracy improvement).

While recent studies have introduced some methods to improve prediction performance, these approaches still face a significant challenge in handling long-term extrapolation tasks under such complex scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose Phy-SSM, a general-purpose framework that integrates partial physics knowledge into state space models (SSMs) for long-term dynamics forecasting in complex environments. Our motivation is that SSMs can effectively capture long-range dependencies in sequential data and model continuous dynamical systems, while the incorporation of physics knowledge improves generalization ability. The key challenge lies in how to seamlessly incorporate partially known physics into SSMs. To achieve this, we decompose partially known system dynamics into known and unknown state matrices, which are integrated into a Phy-SSM unit. To further enhance long-term prediction performance, we introduce a physics state regularization term to make the estimated latent states align with system dynamics. Besides, we theoretically analyze the uniqueness of the solutions for our method. Extensive experiments on three real-world applications, including vehicle motion prediction, drone state prediction, and COVID-19 epidemiology forecasting, demonstrate the superior performance of Phy-SSM over the baselines in both long-term interpolation and extrapolation tasks. The source code will be publicly available upon publication.",

Layer-wise relevance propagation for GNNs (GNN-LRP) evaluates the relevance of walks to reveal important information flows in the network, and provides higher-order explanations, which have been shown to be superior to the lower-order, i.e., node-/edge-level, explanations. However, identifying relevant walks by GNN-LRP requires exponential computational complexity with respect to the network depth, which we will remedy in this paper. Specifically, we propose polynomial-time algorithms for finding top-$K$ relevant walks, which drastically reduces the computation and thus increases the applicability of GNN-LRP to large-scale problems. Our proposed algorithms are based on the max-product algorithm---a common tool for finding the maximum likelihood configurations in probabilistic graphical models---and can find the most relevant walks exactly at the neuron level and approximately at the node level. Our experiments demonstrate the performance of our algorithms at scale and their utility across application domains, i.e., on epidemiology, molecular, and natural language benchmarks.

However, the sparse-group lasso can be computationally expensive, due to the added shrinkage complexity, and its additional hyperparameter that needs tuning. This paper presents a novel feature reduction method, Dual Feature Reduction (DFR), that uses strong screening rules for the sparse-group lasso and the adaptive sparse-group lasso to reduce their input space before optimization, without affecting solution optimality. DFR applies two layers of screening through the application of dual norms and subdifferentials.

However, existing deep-learning methods often overlook the dynamic nature of epidemics and fail to account for the specific mechanisms of disease transmission. In response to these challenges, we introduce an innovative end-to-end framework called Epidemiology-Aware Neural ODE with Continuous Disease Transmission Graph (EARTH) in this paper. To learn continuous and regional disease transmission patterns, we first propose EANO, which seamlessly integrates the neural ODE approach with the epidemic mechanism, considering the complex spatial spread process during epidemic evolution. Additionally, we introduce GLTG to model global infection trends and leverage these signals to guide local transmission dynamically. To accommodate both the global coherence of epidemic trends and the local nuances of epidemic transmission patterns, we build a cross-attention approach to fuse the most meaningful information for forecasting. Through the smooth synergy of both components, EARTH offers a more robust and flexible approach to understanding and predicting the spread of infectious diseases. Extensive experiments show EARTH superior performance in forecasting real-world epidemics compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/GuanchengWan/EARTH.",

This paper introduces Profile2Gen, a novel data-centric framework designed to guide the generation and refinement of synthetic data, focusing on addressing hard-to-learn samples in regression tasks. We conducted approximately 18,000 experiments to validate its effectiveness across six medical datasets, utilizing seven state-of-the-art generative models.

Recently, graph neural networks have recently shown great success in molecular relational learning by modeling a molecule as a graph structure, and considering atom-level interactions between two molecules. Despite their success, existing molecular relational learning methods tend to overlook the nature of chemistry, i.e., a chemical compound is composed of multiple substructures such as functional groups that cause distinctive chemical reactions. In this work, we propose a novel relational learning framework, called CGIB, that predicts the interaction behavior between a pair of graphs by detecting core subgraphs therein. The main idea is, given a pair of graphs, to find a subgraph from a graph that contains the minimal sufficient information regarding the task at hand conditioned on the paired graph based on the principle of conditional graph information bottleneck. We argue that our proposed method mimics the nature of chemical reactions, i.e., the core substructure of a molecule varies depending on which other molecule it interacts with. Extensive experiments on various tasks with real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of CGIB over state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Namkyeong/CGIB.",

Machine learning methods have achieved good success by learning graph neural networks to model spatial interactions. However, these approaches do not faithfully capture temporal correlations since they only model next-step predictions. In this work, we propose Equivariant Graph Neural Operator (EGNO), a novel and principled method that directly models dynamics as trajectories instead of just next-step prediction. Different from existing methods, EGNO explicitly learns the temporal evolution of 3D dynamics where we formulate the dynamics as a function over time and learn neural operators to approximate it. To capture the temporal correlations while keeping the intrinsic SE(3)-equivariance, we develop equivariant temporal convolutions parameterized in the Fourier space and build EGNO by stacking the Fourier layers over equivariant networks. EGNO is the first operator learning framework that is capable of modeling solution dynamics functions over time while retaining 3D equivariance. Comprehensive experiments in multiple domains, including particle simulations, human motion capture, and molecular dynamics, demonstrate the significantly superior performance of EGNO against existing methods, thanks to the equivariant temporal modeling.

Clustering such time-series data is crucial for patient phenotyping, anticipating patients\u2019 prognoses by identifying \u201csimilar\u201d patients, and designing treatment guidelines that are tailored to homogeneous patient subgroups. In this paper, we develop a deep learning approach for clustering time-series data, where each cluster comprises patients who share similar future outcomes of interest (e.g., adverse events, the onset of comorbidities). To encourage each cluster to have homogeneous future outcomes, the clustering is carried out by learning discrete representations that best describe the future outcome distribution based on novel loss functions. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our model achieves superior clustering performance over state-of-the-art benchmarks and identifies meaningful clusters that can be translated into actionable information for clinical decision-making.",

Under assumptions of sequential ignorability, monotonicity, and perfect positive rank, we show that the posterior causal estimands of interest are identifiable and present the corresponding identification equations.

This work explores how to repurpose general LLMs into effective task solvers for specialized domains. We introduce a novel, model-agnostic framework for learning custom input tags, which are parameterized as continuous vectors appended to the LLM\u2019s embedding layer, to condition the LLM. We design two types of input tags: domain tags are used to delimit specialized representations (e.g., chemical formulas) and provide domain-relevant context; function tags are used to represent specific functions (e.g., predicting molecular properties) and compress function-solving instructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn these tags using auxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling task domains from task functions, our method enables zero-shot generalization to unseen problems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM\u2019s performance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein or chemical properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expert models tailored to these tasks.",

Algorithmic fairness examines how a model's performance varies across socially relevant groups defined by protected attributes such as age, gender, or race. In this work, we explore the interplay between the performance gains from Deep Ensembles and fairness. Our analysis reveals that they unevenly favor different groups, a phenomenon that we term the disparate benefits effect. We empirically investigate this effect using popular facial analysis and medical imaging datasets with protected group attributes and find that it affects multiple established group fairness metrics, including statistical parity and equal opportunity. Furthermore, we identify that the per-group differences in predictive diversity of ensemble members can explain this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that the classical Hardt post-processing method is particularly effective at mitigating the disparate benefits effect of Deep Ensembles by leveraging their better-calibrated predictive distributions.",

To address this, we introduce the Delta Score, a new metric for evaluating the specificity of molecular binding.

Thus, it is essential to develop multimodal learning methods to aggregate information from multiple modalities. The main challenge is appropriately aligning and fusing the representations of different modalities into a joint distribution. Existing methods mainly rely on concatenation or the Kronecker product, oversimplifying interactions structure between modalities and indicating a need to model more complex interactions. Additionally, the joint distribution of latent representations with higher-order interactions is underexplored. Copula is a powerful statistical structure in modelling the interactions between variables, as it bridges the joint distribution and marginal distributions of multiple variables. In this paper, we propose a novel copula modelling-driven multimodal learning framework, which focuses on learning the joint distribution of various modalities to capture the complex interaction among them. The key idea is interpreting the copula model as a tool to align the marginal distributions of the modalities efficiently. By assuming a Gaussian mixture distribution for each modality and a copula model on the joint distribution, our model can also generate accurate representations for missing modalities. Extensive experiments on public MIMIC datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors. The code is anonymously available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/CMCM.",

Here, we focus on the widespread setting where the observational data come from multiple environments, such as different hospitals, physicians, or countries. Furthermore, we allow for violations of standard causal assumptions, namely, overlap within the environments and unconfoundedness. To this end, we move away from point identification and focus on partial identification. Specifically, we show that current assumptions from the literature on multiple environments allow us to interpret the environment as an instrumental variable (IV). This allows us to adapt bounds from the IV literature for partial identification of CATE by leveraging treatment assignment mechanisms across environments. Then, we propose different model-agnostic learners (so-called meta-learners) to estimate the bounds that can be used in combination with arbitrary machine learning models. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our meta-learners across various experiments using both simulated and real-world data.

Data-driven decision-making requires the ability to predict *what happens if a policy is changed*. Existing methods that predict how the outcome evolves under different scenarios assume that the tentative sequences of future treatments are fixed in advance, while in practice the treatments are determined stochastically by a policy and may depend, for example, on the efficiency of previous treatments. Therefore, the current methods are not applicable if the treatment policy is unknown or a counterfactual analysis is needed. To handle these limitations, we model the treatments and outcomes jointly in continuous time, by combining Gaussian processes and point processes. Our model enables the estimation of a treatment policy from observational sequences of treatments and outcomes, and it can predict the interventional and counterfactual progression of the outcome *after an intervention on the treatment policy* (in contrast with the causal effect of a single treatment). We show with real-world and semi-synthetic data on blood glucose progression that our method can answer causal queries more accurately than existing alternatives.",

The molecular model is governed by physical laws, which impose geometric constraints such as invariance and equivariance to coordinate rotation and translation. While numerous deep learning approaches have been developed to learn molecular representations under these constraints, most of them are built upon heuristic and costly modules. We argue that there is a strong need for a general and flexible framework for learning both invariant and equivariant features. In this work, we introduce a novel Transformer-based molecular model called GeoMFormer to achieve this goal. Using the standard Transformer modules, two separate streams are developed to maintain and learn invariant and equivariant representations. Carefully designed _cross-attention_ modules bridge the two streams, allowing information fusion and enhancing geometric modeling in each stream. As a general and flexible architecture, we show that many previous architectures can be viewed as special instantiations of GeoMFormer. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the power of GeoMFormer. All empirical results show that GeoMFormer achieves strong performance on both invariant and equivariant tasks of different types and scales.

There is an increasing interest to harvest machine learning methods to reconstruct this latent DS in a data-driven, unsupervised way. In many areas of science it is common to sample time series observations from many data modalities simultaneously, e.g. electrophysiological and behavioral time series in a typical neuroscience experiment. However, current machine learning tools for reconstructing DSs usually focus on just one data modality. Here we propose a general framework for multi-modal data integration for the purpose of nonlinear DS reconstruction and the analysis of cross-modal relations. This framework is based on dynamically interpretable recurrent neural networks as general approximators of nonlinear DSs, coupled to sets of modality-specific decoder models from the class of generalized linear models. Both an expectation-maximization and a variational inference algorithm for model training are advanced and compared. We show on nonlinear DS benchmarks that our algorithms can efficiently compensate for too noisy or missing information in one data channel by exploiting other channels, and demonstrate on experimental neuroscience data how the algorithm learns to link different data domains to the underlying dynamics.",

However, many tasks involve continuously indexed domains. For example, in medical applications, one often needs to transfer disease analysis and prediction across patients of different ages, where age acts as a continuous domain index. Such tasks are challenging for prior domain adaptation methods since they ignore the underlying relation among domains. In this paper, we propose the first method for continuously indexed domain adaptation. Our approach combines traditional adversarial adaptation with a novel discriminator that models the encoding-conditioned domain index distribution. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the value of leveraging the domain index to generate invariant features across a continuous range of domains. Our empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaption methods on both synthetic and real-world medical datasets.",

Existing studies have focused on either (1) voxel-level activity, where only a single weight relating the voxel activity to the task (i.e., aggregation of voxel activity over a time window) is considered, missing their temporal dynamics, or (2) functional connectivity of the brain in the level of region of interests, missing voxel-level activities. We bridge this gap and design BrainMixer, an unsupervised learning framework that effectively utilizes both functional connectivity and associated time series of voxels to learn voxel-level representation in an unsupervised manner. BrainMixer employs two simple yet effective MLP-based encoders to simultaneously learn the dynamics of voxel-level signals and their functional correlations. To encode voxel activity, BrainMixer fuses information across both time and voxel dimensions via a dynamic attention mechanism. To learn the structure of the functional connectivity, BrainMixer presents a temporal graph patching and encodes each patch by combining its nodes' features via a new adaptive temporal pooling. Our experiments show that BrainMixer attains outstanding performance and outperforms 14 baselines in different downstream tasks and setups.",

In this paper, we explore this question through the scope of time series diffusion models. More specifically, we analyze whether representing time series in the frequency domain is a useful inductive bias for score-based diffusion models. By starting from the canonical SDE formulation of diffusion in the time domain, we show that a dual diffusion process occurs in the frequency domain with an important nuance: Brownian motions are replaced by what we call mirrored Brownian motions, characterized by mirror symmetries among their components. Building on this insight, we show how to adapt the denoising score matching approach to implement diffusion models in the frequency domain. This results in frequency diffusion models, which we compare to canonical time diffusion models. Our empirical evaluation on real-world datasets, covering various domains like healthcare and finance, shows that frequency diffusion models better capture the training distribution than time diffusion models. We explain this observation by showing that time series from these datasets tend to be more localized in the frequency domain than in the time domain, which makes them easier to model in the former case. All our observations point towards impactful synergies between Fourier analysis and diffusion models.",

However, most existing structure-based pre-trained models primarily focus on the residue level, i.e., alpha carbon atoms, while ignoring other atoms like side chain atoms. We argue that modeling proteins at both residue and atom levels is important since the side chain atoms can also be crucial for numerous downstream tasks, for example, molecular docking. Nevertheless, we find that naively combining residue and atom information during pre-training typically fails. We identify a key reason is the information leakage caused by the inclusion of atom structure in the input, which renders residue-level pre-training tasks trivial and results in insufficiently expressive residue representations. To address this issue, we introduce a span mask pre-training strategy on 3D protein chains to learn meaningful representations of both residues and atoms. This leads to a simple yet effective approach to learning protein representation suitable for diverse downstream tasks. Extensive experimental results on binding site prediction and function prediction tasks demonstrate our proposed pre-training approach significantly outperforms other methods.

To mitigate the costs, we propose *Guided Adversarial Training * (GAT), a novel adversarial training technique that exploits auxiliary tasks under a limited set of training data. Our approach extends single-task models into multi-task models during the min-max optimization of adversarial training, and drives the loss optimization with a regularization of the gradient curvature across multiple tasks. GAT leverages two types of auxiliary tasks: self-supervised tasks, where the labels are generated automatically, and domain-knowledge tasks, where human experts provide additional labels. Experimentally, under limited data, GAT increases the robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 up to four times (from 11% to 42% robust accuracy) and the robust AUC of CheXpert medical imaging dataset from 50% to 83%. On the full CIFAR-10 dataset, GAT outperforms eight state-of-the-art adversarial training strategies.

While the primary goal in experiment is to maximize estimation accuracy, due to the imperative of social welfare, it's also crucial to provide treatment with superior outcomes to patients, which is measured by regret in contextual bandit framework. Furthermore, privacy concerns arise in clinical scenarios containing sensitive data like patients health records. Therefore, it's essential for the treatment allocation mechanism to incorporate robust privacy protection measures. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoff between loss of social welfare and statistical power of CATE estimation in contextual bandit experiment. We propose a matched upper and lower bound for the multi-objective optimization problem, and then adopt the concept of Pareto optimality to mathematically characterize the optimality condition. Furthermore, we propose differentially private algorithms which still matches the lower bound, showing that privacy is \"almost free\".

Numerous methods have been developed for learning such policies from observational data that achieve the best outcome across a certain policy class. Yet these methods are rarely interpretable. However, interpretability is often a prerequisite for policy learning in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for interpretable off-policy learning via hyperbox search. In particular, our policies can be represented in disjunctive normal form (i.e., OR-of-ANDs) and are thus intelligible. We prove a universal approximation theorem that shows that our policy class is flexible enough to approximate any measurable function arbitrarily well. For optimization, we develop a tailored column generation procedure within a branch-and-bound framework. Using a simulation study, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods from interpretable off-policy learning in terms of regret. Using real-word clinical data, we perform a user study with actual clinical experts, who rate our policies as highly interpretable.",

To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{TinyMIG}, a framework designed to transfer generalization capabilities from vision foundation models to medical imaging SDG. TinyMIG aims to enable lightweight specialized models to mimic the strong generalization capabilities of foundation models in terms of both global feature distribution and local fine-grained details during training. Specifically, for global feature distribution, we propose a Global Distribution Consistency Learning strategy that mimics the prior distributions of the foundation model layer by layer. For local fine-grained details, we further design a Localized Representation Alignment method, which promotes semantic alignment and generalization distillation between the specialized model and the foundation model. These mechanisms collectively enable the specialized model to achieve robust performance in diverse medical imaging scenarios. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that TinyMIG, with extremely low computational cost, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, showcasing its superior SDG capabilities. All the code and model weights will be publicly available.",

The siloed datasets, coupled with the escalating privacy concerns related to local data sharing, have inspired recent innovations extending conformal prediction into federated environments with distributed data samples. However, this framework for distributed uncertainty quantification is susceptible to Byzantine failures. A minor subset of malicious clients can significantly compromise the practicality of coverage guarantees. To address this vulnerability, we introduce a novel framework Rob-FCP, which executes robust federated conformal prediction, effectively countering malicious clients capable of reporting arbitrary statistics with the conformal calibration process. We theoretically provide the conformal coverage bound of Rob-FCP in the Byzantine setting and show that the coverage of Rob-FCP is asymptotically close to the desired coverage level. We also propose a malicious client number estimator to tackle a more challenging setting where the number of malicious clients is unknown to the defender and theoretically shows its effectiveness. We empirically demonstrate the robustness of Rob-FCP against diverse proportions of malicious clients under a variety of Byzantine attacks on five standard benchmark and real-world healthcare datasets.",

Practitioners in this domain prefer linear or tree-based models over neural networks since the latter are harder to interpret and tend to overfit when applied to tabular datasets. To address these neural networks\u2019 shortcomings, we propose an intrinsically interpretable network for heterogeneous biomedical data. We design a locally sparse neural network where the local sparsity is learned to identify the subset of most relevant features for each sample. This sample-specific sparsity is predicted via a gating network, which is trained in tandem with the prediction network. By forcing the model to select a subset of the most informative features for each sample, we reduce model overfitting in low-sample-size data and obtain an interpretable model. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models when applied to synthetic or real-world biomedical datasets using extensive experiments.

Our method first addresses irregularity in each single modality by (1) modeling irregular time series by dynamically incorporating hand-crafted imputation embeddings into learned interpolation embeddings via a gating mechanism, and (2) casting a series of clinical note representations as multivariate irregular time series and tackling irregularity via a time attention mechanism. We further integrate irregularity in multimodal fusion with an interleaved attention mechanism across temporal steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to thoroughly model irregularity in multimodalities for improving medical predictions. Our proposed methods for two medical prediction tasks consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in each single modality and multimodal fusion scenarios.

    "abstract": "Generating graph-structured data requires learning the underlying distribution of graphs. Yet, this is a challenging problem, and the previous graph generative methods either fail to capture the permutation-invariance property of graphs or cannot sufficiently model the complex dependency between nodes and edges, which is crucial for generating real-world graphs such as molecules. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel score-based generative model for graphs with a continuous-time framework. Specifically, we propose a new graph diffusion process that models the joint distribution of the nodes and edges through a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Then, we derive novel score matching objectives tailored for the proposed diffusion process to estimate the gradient of the joint log-density with respect to each component, and introduce a new solver for the system of SDEs to efficiently sample from the reverse diffusion process. We validate our graph generation method on diverse datasets, on which it either achieves significantly superior or competitive performance to the baselines. Further analysis shows that our method is able to generate molecules that lie close to the training distribution yet do not violate the chemical valency rule, demonstrating the effectiveness of the system of SDEs in modeling the node-edge relationships.",

To address this issue, economists are increasingly considering the triple difference estimator as a more credible alternative.

An alternative avenue is offered by the changes-in-changes (CiC) estimator, which provides an estimate of the entire counterfactual distribution by relying on assumptions imposed on the distribution of potential outcomes. In this work, we extend the triple difference estimator to accommodate the CiC framework, presenting the `triple changes estimator' and its identification assumptions, thereby expanding the scope of the CiC paradigm.

ITE prediction models deployed in critical settings such as healthcare should ideally be (i) accurate, and (ii) provide faithful explanations. However, current solutions are inadequate: state-of-the-art black-box models do not supply explanations, post-hoc explainers for black-box models lack faithfulness guarantees, and self-interpretable models greatly compromise accuracy. To address these issues, we propose DISCRET, a self-interpretable ITE framework that synthesizes faithful, rule-based explanations for each sample. A key insight behind DISCRET is that explanations can serve dually as *database queries* to identify similar subgroups of samples. We provide a novel RL algorithm to efficiently synthesize these explanations from a large search space. We evaluate DISCRET on diverse tasks involving tabular, image, and text data. DISCRET outperforms the best self-interpretable models and has accuracy comparable to the best black-box models while providing faithful explanations.

A key outstanding challenge in this field involves identifying the sequence of amino acids -the peptide- responsible for generating each observed spectrum, without making use of prior knowledge in the form of a peptide sequence database. Although various machine learning methods have been developed to address this de novo sequencing problem, challenges that arise when modeling tandem mass spectra have led to complex models that combine multiple neural networks and post-processing steps. We propose a simple yet powerful method for de novo peptide sequencing, Casanovo, that uses a transformer framework to map directly from a sequence of observed peaks (a mass spectrum) to a sequence of amino acids (a peptide). Our experiments show that Casanovo achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset using a standard cross-species evaluation framework which involves testing with spectra with never-before-seen peptide labels. Casanovo not only achieves superior performance but does so at a fraction of the model complexity and inference time required by other methods.",

This poses the critical challenge of establishing links between neural activity at a microscopic scale, which might for instance represent sensory input, and at a macroscopic scale, which then generates behaviour. Predominant modeling methods apply rather disjoint techniques to these scales; by contrast, we suggest an end-to-end model which exploits recent developments of flexible, but tractable, neural network point-process models to characterize dependencies between stimuli, actions, and neural data. We apply this model to a public dataset collected using Neuropixel probes in mice performing a visually-guided behavioural task as well as a synthetic dataset produced from a hierarchical network model with reciprocally connected sensory and integration circuits intended to characterize animal behaviour in a fixed-duration motion discrimination task.

For this, we combine three transformer subnetworks with separate inputs for time-varying covariates, previous treatments, and previous outcomes into a joint network with in-between cross-attentions. We further develop a custom, end-to-end training procedure for our Causal Transformer. Specifically, we propose a novel counterfactual domain confusion loss to address confounding bias: it aims to learn adversarial balanced representations, so that they are predictive of the next outcome but non-predictive of the current treatment assignment. We evaluate our Causal Transformer based on synthetic and real-world datasets, where it achieves superior performance over current baselines.

To address this limitation, we novelly leverage two causal desiderata, non-spuriousness and efficiency, into rationalization from the causal inference perspective. We formally define a series of probabilities of causation based on a newly proposed structural causal model of rationalization, with its theoretical identification established as the main component of learning necessary and sufficient rationales. The superior performance of the proposed causal rationalization is demonstrated on real-world review and medical datasets with extensive experiments compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of neurodegenerative diseases on brain connectomes is important in facilitating early diagnosis and predicting its onset. However, investigation of the progressive and irreversible dynamics of these diseases remains underexplored in cross-sectional studies as its diagnostic groups are considered independent. Also, as in many real-world graphs, brain networks exhibit intricate structures with both homophily and heterophily. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Graph diffusion network with Temporal regularization (AGT). AGT introduces node-wise convolution to adaptively capture low (i.e., homophily) and high-frequency (i.e., heterophily) characteristics within an optimally tailored range for each node. Moreover, AGT captures sequential variations within progressive diagnostic groups with a novel temporal regularization, considering the relative feature distance between the groups in the latent space. As a result, our proposed model yields interpretable results at both node-level and group-level. The superiority of our method is validated on two neurodegenerative disease benchmarks for graph classification: Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) datasets.",

This time-consuming process causes ED crowding which impacts patient mortality, medical errors, staff burnout, etc. This work proposes (time) *cost-effective diagnostic assistance* that leverages artificial intelligence systems to help ED clinicians make efficient and accurate diagnoses. In collaboration with ED clinicians, we use public patient data to curate MIMIC-ED-Assist, a benchmark for AI systems to suggest laboratory tests that minimize wait time while accurately predicting critical outcomes such as death. With MIMIC-ED-Assist, we develop ED-Copilot which sequentially suggests patient-specific laboratory tests and makes diagnostic predictions. ED-Copilot employs a pre-trained bio-medical language model to encode patient information and uses reinforcement learning to minimize ED wait time and maximize prediction accuracy. On MIMIC-ED-Assist, ED-Copilot improves prediction accuracy over baselines while halving average wait time from four hours to two hours. ED-Copilot can also effectively personalize treatment recommendations based on patient severity, further highlighting its potential as a diagnostic assistant. Since MIMIC-ED-Assist is a retrospective benchmark, ED-Copilot is restricted to recommend only observed tests. We show ED-Copilot achieves competitive performance without this restriction as the maximum allowed time increases. Our code is available at https://github.com/cxcscmu/ED-Copilot.",

While direct application of Large Language Models (LLMs) can incorporate external knowledge, they lack the capability for spatial reasoning with guaranteed equivariance. In this paper, we propose EquiLLM, a novel framework for representing 3D physical systems that seamlessly integrates $\\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariance with LLM capabilities. Specifically, EquiLLM comprises four key components: geometry-aware prompting, an equivariant encoder, an LLM, and an equivariant adapter. Essentially, the LLM guided by the instructive prompt serves as a sophisticated invariant feature processor, while 3D directional information is exclusively handled by the equivariant encoder and adapter modules. Experimental results demonstrate that EquiLLM delivers significant improvements over previous methods across molecular dynamics simulation, human motion simulation, and antibody design, highlighting its promising generalizability.",

Often such time series may consist of discrete random variables rather than continuous measurements, or may be composed of measurements from multiple data modalities observed simultaneously. For instance, in neuroscience we may have behavioral labels in addition to spike counts and continuous physiological recordings. While by now there is a burgeoning literature on deep learning for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR), multimodal data integration has hardly been considered in this context. Here we provide such an efficient and flexible algorithmic framework that rests on a multimodal variational autoencoder for generating a sparse teacher signal that guides training of a reconstruction model, exploiting recent advances in DSR training techniques. It enables to combine various sources of information for optimal reconstruction, even allows for reconstruction from symbolic data (class labels) alone, and connects different types of observations within a common latent dynamics space. In contrast to previous multimodal data integration techniques for scientific applications, our framework is fully generative, producing, after training, trajectories with the same geometrical and temporal structure as those of the ground truth system.",

The optimality of various RL algorithms relies on the stationarity assumption, which requires time-invariant state transition and reward functions. However, deviations from stationarity over extended periods often occur in real-world applications like robotics control, health care and digital marketing, resulting in suboptimal policies learned under stationary assumptions. In this paper, we propose a model-based doubly robust procedure for testing the stationarity assumption and detecting change points in offline RL settings with certain degree of homogeneity. Our proposed testing procedure is robust to model misspecifications and can effectively control type-I error while achieving high statistical power, especially in high-dimensional settings. Extensive comparative simulations and a real-world interventional mobile health example illustrate the advantages of our method in detecting change points and optimizing long-term rewards in high-dimensional, non-stationary environments.",

However, they typically function as components within larger structures in real-world scenarios, such as in protein-protein interactions where each protein is a graph in a larger network. This study delves into the Graph-of-Net (GON), a structure that extends the concept of traditional graphs by representing each node as a graph itself. It provides a multi-level perspective on the relationships between objects, encapsulating both the detailed structure of individual nodes and the broader network of dependencies. To learn node representations within the GON, we propose a position-aware neural network for Graph-of-Net which processes both intra-graph and inter-graph connections and incorporates additional data like node labels. Our model employs dual encoders and graph constructors to build and refine a constraint network, where nodes are adaptively arranged based on their positions, as determined by the network's constraint system. Our model demonstrates significant improvements over baselines in empirical evaluations on various datasets.",

The standard method for training machine learning models while ensuring privacy for units of sensitive information, such as individual hospital visits, is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). However, we observe in this work that the formal guarantees of DP-SGD are incompatible with time series specific tasks like forecasting, since they rely on the *privacy amplification* attained by training on small, unstructured batches sampled from an unstructured dataset. In contrast, batches for forecasting are generated by (1) sampling sequentially structured time series from a dataset, (2) sampling contiguous subsequences from these series, and (3) partitioning them into context and ground-truth forecast windows. We theoretically analyze the privacy amplification attained by this *structured subsampling* to enable the training of forecasting models with sound and tight event- and user-level privacy guarantees. Towards more private models, we additionally prove how data augmentation amplifies privacy in self-supervised training of sequence models. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that amplification by structured subsampling enables the training of forecasting models with strong formal privacy guarantees.",

Despite their potential, the scarcity of publicly available DEL datasets presents a bottleneck for the advancement of machine learning methodologies in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce KinDEL, one of the largest publicly accessible DEL datasets and the first one that includes binding poses from molecular docking experiments. Focused on two kinases, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14 (MAPK14) and Discoidin Domain Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 1 (DDR1), KinDEL includes 81 million compounds, offering a rich resource for computational exploration. Additionally,  we provide comprehensive biophysical assay validation data, encompassing both on-DNA and off-DNA measurements, which we use to evaluate a suite of machine learning techniques, including novel structure-based probabilistic models. We hope that our benchmark, encompassing both 2D and 3D structures, will help advance the development of machine learning models for data-driven hit identification using DELs.",

However, most of these algorithms assume accurate estimation of the data distribution, which is impractical for high-dimensional variables such as images. On the other hand, modern deep generative architectures can be trained to sample from high-dimensional distributions. However, training these networks are typically very costly. Thus, it is desirable to leverage pre-trained models to answer causal queries using such high-dimensional data. To address this, we propose modular training of deep causal generative models that not only makes learning more efficient, but also allows us to utilize large, pre-trained conditional generative models. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm, Modular-DCM is the first algorithm that, given the causal structure, uses adversarial training to learn the network weights, and can make use of pre-trained models to provably sample from any identifiable causal query in the presence of latent confounders. With extensive experiments on the Colored-MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the baselines. We also show our algorithm's convergence on the COVIDx dataset and its utility with a causal invariant prediction problem on CelebA-HQ.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various domains such as social networks, molecular biology, or recommendation systems. Concurrently, different explanations methods of GNNs have arisen to complement its blackbox nature. Explanations of the GNNs\u2019 predictions can be categorized into two types\u2014factual and counterfactual. Given a GNN trained on binary classification into \u201caccept\u201d and \u201creject\u201d classes, a global counterfactual explanation consists in generating a small set of \u201caccept\u201d graphs relevant to all of the input \u201creject\u201d graphs. The transformation of a \u201creject\u201d graph into an \u201caccept\u201d graph is called a recourse. A common recourse explanation is a small set of recourse, from which every \u201creject\u201d graph can be turned into an \u201caccept\u201d graph. Although local counterfactual explanations have been studied extensively, the problem of finding common recourse for global counterfactual explanation remains unexplored, particularly for GNNs. In this paper, we formalize the common recourse explanation problem, and design an effective algorithm, COMRECGC, to solve it. We benchmark our algorithm against strong baselines on four different real-world graphs datasets and demonstrate the superior performance of COMRECGC against the competitors. We also compare the common recourse explanations to the graph counterfactual explanation, showing that common recourse explanations are either comparable or superior, making them worth considering for applications such as drug discovery or computational biology.",

Even for the most data-efficient MLFFs, reaching chemical accuracy can require hundreds of frames of force and energy labels generated by expensive quantum mechanical algorithms, which may scale as $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^7)$, with $n$ proportional to the number of basis functions. To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage computational framework -- ASTEROID, which lowers the data cost of MLFFs by leveraging a combination of cheap inaccurate data and expensive accurate data. The motivation behind ASTEROID is that inaccurate data, though incurring large bias, can help capture the sophisticated structures of the underlying force field. Therefore, we first train a MLFF model on a large amount of inaccurate training data, employing a bias-aware loss function to prevent the model from overfitting the potential bias of this data. We then fine-tune the obtained model using a small amount of accurate training data, which preserves the knowledge learned from the inaccurate training data while significantly improving the model's accuracy. Moreover, we propose a variant of ASTEROID based on score matching for the setting where the inaccurate training data are unlabeled. Extensive experiments on MD datasets and downstream tasks validate the efficacy of ASTEROID. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/abukharin3/asteroid.",

Finally, Mixture VAEs are here, for the first time, compared and combined with normalizing flows, hierarchical models and/or the VampPrior in an extensive ablation study.

Current strategies use a decoupled approach of single-step retrosynthesis models and search algorithms, taking only the product as the input to predict the reactants for each planning step and ignoring valuable context information along the synthetic route. In this work, we propose a novel framework that utilizes context information for improved retrosynthetic planning. We view synthetic routes as reaction graphs and propose to incorporate context through three principled steps: encode molecules into embeddings, aggregate information over routes, and readout to predict reactants. Our approach is the first attempt to utilize in-context learning for retrosynthesis prediction in retrosynthetic planning. The entire framework can be efficiently optimized in an end-to-end fashion and produce more practical and accurate predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that by fusing in the context information over routes, our model significantly improves the performance of retrosynthetic planning over baselines that are not context-aware, especially for long synthetic routes.

These new methods have the potential to fuel a new era of data-driven automation in scientific discovery. However, specialized models are still typically required for each task, leading to the need for problem-specific fine-tuning and neglecting task interrelations. The main obstacle in this field is the lack of a unified representation between natural language and chemical representations, complicating and limiting human-machine interaction. Here, we propose the first multi-domain, multi-task language model that can solve a wide range of tasks in both the chemical and natural language domains. Our model can handle chemical and natural language concurrently, without requiring expensive pre-training on single domains or task-specific models. Interestingly, sharing weights across domains remarkably improves our model when benchmarked against state-of-the-art baselines on single-domain and cross-domain tasks. In particular, sharing information across domains and tasks gives rise to large improvements in cross-domain tasks, the magnitude of which increase with scale, as measured by more than a dozen of relevant metrics. Our work suggests that such models can robustly and efficiently accelerate discovery in physical sciences by superseding problem-specific fine-tuning and enhancing human-model interactions.",

Despite its strengths, SAM encounters two major challenges. Firstly, it struggles with segmenting specific objects autonomously, as it relies on users to manually input prompts like points or bounding boxes to identify targeted objects. Secondly, SAM faces challenges in excelling at specific downstream tasks, like medical imaging, due to a disparity between the distribution of its pretraining data, which predominantly consists of general-domain images, and the data used in downstream tasks. Current solutions to these problems, which involve finetuning SAM, often lead to overfitting, a notable issue in scenarios with very limited data, like in medical imaging. To overcome these limitations, we introduce BLO-SAM, which finetunes SAM based on bi-level optimization (BLO). Our approach allows for automatic image segmentation without the need for manual prompts, by optimizing a learnable prompt embedding. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the risk of overfitting by training the model's weight parameters and the prompt embedding on two separate subsets of the training dataset, each at a different level of optimization. We apply BLO-SAM to diverse semantic segmentation tasks in general and medical domains. The results demonstrate BLO-SAM's superior performance over various state-of-the-art image semantic segmentation methods. The code of BLO-SAM is available at https://github.com/importZL/BLO-SAM.",

Here, we propose a first-of-its-kind quantum computing formulation for amortized optimization of contextualized transportation plans. We exploit a direct link between doubly stochastic matrices and unitary operators thus unravelling a natural connection between OT and quantum computation. We verify our method (QontOT) on synthetic and real data by predicting variations in cell type distributions conditioned on drug dosage. Importantly we conduct a 24-qubit hardware experiment on a task challenging for classical computers and report a performance that cannot be matched with our classical neural OT approach.

Through a modality-agnostic **Pa**tch **Re**placement scheme, these patches are preserved and combined to construct data-rich intermediate modalities ranging from easy to hard. By gradually intermediate modality generation, we can not only effectively bridge the modality gap to enhance stability and transferability of cross-modal fine-tuning, but also address the challenge of limited data in the target modality by leveraging enriched intermediate modality data.

Furthermore, bridging modality gaps and leveraging large-scale pretrained models for protein-related tasks aligns with AI applications in biomolecular modeling and understanding of biological systems, both of which are core aspects of Biomedicine AI. While the paper may have broader applicability to other domains, the specific mention of protein sequences justifies its classification under Biomedicine AI.",

A series of recent approaches follow a prevalent framework: an encoder-only model coupled with a coordinate denoising objective. However, through a series of analytical experiments, we prove that the encoder-only model with coordinate denoising objective exhibits inconsistency between pre-training and downstream objectives, as well as issues with disrupted atomic identifiers. To address these two issues, we propose Mol-AE for molecular representation learning, an auto-encoder model using positional encoding as atomic identifiers. We also propose a new training objective named 3D Cloze Test to make the model learn better atom spatial relationships from real molecular substructures. Empirical results demonstrate that Mol-AE achieves a large margin performance gain compared to the current state-of-the-art 3D molecular modeling approach.",

In this work, we propose cvHM, a general inference framework for latent GP models leveraging Hida-Mat\u00e9rn kernels and conjugate computation variational inference (CVI). With cvHM, we are able to perform variational inference of latent neural trajectories with linear time complexity for arbitrary likelihoods. The reparameterization of stationary kernels using Hida-Mat\u00e9rn GPs helps us connect the latent variable models that encode prior assumptions through dynamical systems to those that encode trajectory assumptions through GPs. In contrast to previous work, we use bidirectional information filtering, leading to a more concise implementation.

To tackle this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Textual Inversion for Molecular Generation (HI-Mol), a novel data-efficient molecular generation method. HI-Mol is inspired by the importance of hierarchical information, e.g., both coarse- and fine-grained features, in understanding the molecule distribution. We propose to use multi-level embeddings to reflect such hierarchical features based on the adoption of the recent textual inversion technique in the visual domain, which achieves data-efficient image generation. Compared to the conventional textual inversion method in the image domain using a single-level token embedding, our multi-level token embeddings allow the model to effectively learn the underlying low-shot molecule distribution. We then generate molecules based on the interpolation of the multi-level token embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of HI-Mol with notable data-efficiency. For instance, on QM9, HI-Mol outperforms the prior state-of-the-art method with 50x less training data. We also show the effectiveness of molecules generated by HI-Mol in low-shot molecular property prediction. Code is available at https://github.com/Seojin-Kim/HI-Mol.",

That is, we focus on standard and feedback covariate shift (FCS), where the latter allows for feedback dependencies between train and test data that occur in many decision-making scenarios like experimental design. Whereas prior conformal prediction methods for this problem are in general either extremely computationally demanding or make inefficient use of labeled data, we propose a collection of methods based on the jackknife+ that achieve a practical balance of computational and statistical efficiency. Theoretically, our proposed JAW-FCS method extends the rigorous, finite-sample coverage guarantee of the jackknife+ to FCS. We moreover propose two tunable relaxations to JAW-FCS's computation that maintain finite-sample guarantees: one using only $K$ leave-one-out models (JAW-$K$LOO) and a second building on $K$-fold cross validation+ (WCV+). Practically, we demonstrate that JAW-FCS and its computational relaxations outperform state-of-the-art baselines on a variety of real-world datasets under standard and feedback covariate shift, including for biomolecular design and active learning tasks.",

Motivated by this fact, we first build the ProtDescribe dataset to augment protein sequences with text descriptions of their functions and other important properties. Based on this dataset, we propose the ProtST framework to enhance Protein Sequence pre-training and understanding by biomedical Texts. During pre-training, we design three types of tasks, i.e., unimodal mask prediction, multimodal representation alignment and multimodal mask prediction, to enhance a PLM with protein property information with different granularities and, at the same time, preserve the PLM's original representation power. On downstream tasks, ProtST enables both supervised learning and zero-shot prediction. We verify the superiority of ProtST-induced PLMs over previous ones on diverse representation learning benchmarks. Under the zero-shot setting, we show the effectiveness of ProtST on zero-shot protein classification, and ProtST also enables functional protein retrieval from a large-scale database without any function annotation.",

However, existing approaches often struggle with suboptimal predictive performance, limited task variety, and poor generalization across subjects. In response to this, we propose MindLLM, a model designed for subject-agnostic and versatile fMRI-to-text decoding. MindLLM consists of an fMRI encoder and an off-the-shelf LLM. The fMRI encoder employs a neuroscience-informed attention mechanism, which is capable of accommodating subjects with varying input shapes and thus achieves high-performance subject-agnostic decoding. Moreover, we introduce Brain Instruction Tuning (BIT), a novel approach that enhances the model's ability to capture diverse semantic representations from fMRI signals, facilitating more versatile decoding. We evaluate MindLLM on comprehensive fMRI-to-text benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines, improving downstream tasks by $12.0\\%$, unseen subject generalization by $24.5\\%$, and novel task adaptation by $25.0\\%$.

In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time search method, Neural Genetic Search (NGS), which incorporates the evolutionary mechanism of genetic algorithms into the generation procedure of deep models. The core idea behind NGS is its crossover, which is defined as parent-conditioned generation using trained generative models. This approach offers a versatile and easy-to-implement search algorithm for deep generative models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of NGS through experiments across three distinct domains: routing problems, adversarial prompt generation for language models, and molecular design.",

The predominant Hill-equation model of an ideal enzymatic inhibition unduly simplifies the biochemical reality of many drugs; and for these drugs the widely-used drug performance indicator of the half-inhibitory concentration $IC_{50}$ can lead to poor therapeutic recommendations and poor selections of promising drug candidates. We develop a neural model that uses an embedding of the interaction between drug molecules and the tissue transcriptome to estimate the entire dose-response curve rather than a scalar aggregate. We find that, compared to the prior state of the art, this model excels at interpolating and extrapolating the inhibitory effect of untried concentrations.

Boltzmann generators tackle this problem by pairing normalizing flows with importance sampling to obtain uncorrelated samples under the target distribution. In this paper, we extend the Boltzmann generator framework with two key contributions, denoting our framework Sequential Boltzmann Generators (SBG). The first is a highly efficient Transformer-based normalizing flow operating directly on all-atom Cartesian coordinates. In contrast to the equivariant continuous flows of prior methods, we leverage exactly invertible non-equivariant architectures which are highly efficient during both sample generation and likelihood evaluation. This efficiency unlocks more sophisticated inference strategies beyond standard importance sampling. In particular, we perform inference-time scaling of flow samples using a continuous-time variant of sequential Monte Carlo, in which flow samples are transported towards the target distribution with annealed Langevin dynamics. SBG achieves state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. all metrics on peptide systems, demonstrating the first equilibrium sampling in Cartesian coordinates of tri-, tetra- and hexa-peptides that were thus far intractable for prior Boltzmann generators.",

To bridge this gap, we propose to develop models that can justify the segmentation or detection using clinically relevant terms and point to visual evidence. We address two core challenges: First, we curate a rationale dataset to tackle the lack of paired images, annotations, and textual rationales for training. The dataset includes 180K image-mask-rationale triples with quality evaluated by expert radiologists. Second, we design rationale-informed optimization that disentangles and localizes fine-grained clinical concepts in a self-supervised manner without requiring pixel-level concept annotations.

However, spike trains are non-Gaussian, which motivates combining GPFA with discrete observation models for binned spike count data. The drawback to this approach is that GPFA priors are not conjugate to count model likelihoods, which makes inference challenging. Here we address this obstacle by introducing a fast, approximate inference method for non-conjugate GPFA models. Our approach uses orthogonal second-order polynomials to approximate the nonlinear terms in the non-conjugate log-likelihood, resulting in a method we refer to as polynomial approximate log-likelihood (PAL) estimators. This approximation allows for accurate closed-form evaluation of marginal likelihoods and fast numerical optimization for parameters and hyperparameters. We derive PAL estimators for GPFA models with binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial observations and find the PAL estimation is highly accurate, and achieves faster convergence times compared to existing state-of-the-art inference methods. We also find that PAL hyperparameters can provide sensible initialization for black box variational inference (BBVI), which improves BBVI accuracy. We demonstrate that PAL estimators achieve fast and accurate extraction of latent structure from multi-neuron spike train data.",

Rational antibody design has proven effective in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases like cancers and virus infections. While recent diffusion-based generative models show promise in designing antigen-specific antibodies, the primary challenge lies in the scarcity of labeled antibody-antigen complex data and binding affinity data. We present AbX, a new score-based diffusion generative model guided by evolutionary, physical, and geometric constraints for antibody design. These constraints serve to narrow the search space and provide priors for plausible antibody sequences and structures. Specifically, we leverage a pre-trained protein language model as priors for evolutionary plausible antibodies and introduce additional training objectives for geometric and physical constraints like van der Waals forces. Furthermore, as far as we know, AbX is the first score-based diffusion model with continuous timesteps for antibody design, jointly modeling the discrete sequence space and the $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ structure space. Evaluated on two independent testing sets, we show that AbX outperforms other published methods, achieving higher accuracy in sequence and structure generation and enhanced antibody-antigen binding affinity.

It remains unclear how to combine the strengths of these two approaches and remediate their common issues. To tackle this challenge, we propose a rank-1 parameterization of BNNs, where each weight matrix involves only a distribution on a rank-1 subspace. We also revisit the use of mixture approximate posteriors to capture multiple modes, where unlike typical mixtures, this approach admits a significantly smaller memory increase (e.g., only a 0.4% increase for a ResNet-50 mixture of size 10). We perform a systematic empirical study on the choices of prior, variational posterior, and methods to improve training. For ResNet-50 on ImageNet, Wide ResNet 28-10 on CIFAR-10/100, and an RNN on MIMIC-III, rank-1 BNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance across log-likelihood, accuracy, and calibration on the test sets and out-of-distribution variants.",

Previous works approach the problem by inpainting or conditional generation. Both of them can only scaffold motifs with fixed positions, and the conditional generation cannot guarantee the presence of motifs. However, prior knowledge of the relative motif positions in a protein is not readily available, and constructing a protein with multiple functions in one protein is more general and significant because of the synergies between functions. We propose a Floating Anchor Diffusion (FADiff) model. FADiff allows motifs to float rigidly and independently in the process of diffusion, which guarantees the presence of motifs and automates the motif position design. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of FADiff with high success rates and designable novel scaffolds. To the best of our knowledge, FADiff is the first work to tackle the challenge of scaffolding multiple motifs without relying on the expertise of relative motif positions in the protein.

    "abstract": "Disease-related representations play a crucial role in image-based disease prediction such as cancer diagnosis, due to its considerable generalization capacity. However, it is still a challenge to identify lesion characteristics in obscured images, as many lesions are obscured by other tissues. In this paper, to learn the representations for identifying obscured lesions, we propose a disentanglement learning strategy under the guidance of alpha blending generation in an encoder-decoder framework (DAB-Net). Specifically, we take mammogram mass benign/malignant classification as an example. In our framework, composite obscured mass images are generated by alpha blending and then explicitly disentangled into disease-related mass features and interference glands features. To achieve disentanglement learning, features of these two parts are decoded to reconstruct the mass and the glands with corresponding reconstruction losses, and only disease-related mass features are fed into the classifier for disease prediction. Experimental results on one public dataset DDSM and three in-house datasets demonstrate that the proposed strategy can achieve state-of-the-art performance. DAB-Net achieves substantial improvements of 3.9%~4.4% AUC in obscured cases. Besides, the visualization analysis shows the model can better disentangle the mass and glands in the obscured image, suggesting the effectiveness of our solution in exploring the hidden characteristics in this challenging problem.",

Optimal Transport (OT) lifts a distance between features (the \"ground metric\") to a geometrically meaningful distance between samples. However, there is usually no straightforward choice of ground metric. Supervised ground metric learning approaches exist but require labeled data. In absence of labels, only ad-hoc ground metrics remain. Unsupervised ground metric learning is thus a fundamental problem to enable data-driven applications of OT. In this paper, we propose for the first time a canonical answer by simultaneously computing an OT distance between samples and between features of a dataset. These distance matrices emerge naturally as positive singular vectors of the function mapping ground metrics to OT distances. We provide criteria to ensure the existence and uniqueness of these singular vectors. We then introduce scalable computational methods to approximate them in high-dimensional settings, using stochastic approximation and entropic regularization. Finally, we showcase Wasserstein Singular Vectors on a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset.",

We perform a systematic analysis of transfer learning using PLMs, conducting 370 experiments across a comprehensive suite of factors including different downstream tasks, architectures, model sizes, model depths, and pretraining time. We observe that while almost all downstream tasks do benefit from pretrained models compared to naive sequence representations, for the majority of tasks performance does not scale with pretraining, and instead relies on low-level features learned early in pretraining. Our results point to a mismatch between current PLM pretraining paradigms and most applications of these models, indicating a need for better pretraining methods.",

Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable chemical knowledge, hinting at their potential to tackle complex decision-making tasks in chemistry. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can successfully navigate the highly constrained, multi-step retrosynthesis planning problem. We introduce an efficient scheme for encoding reaction pathways and present a new route-level search strategy, moving beyond the conventional step-by-step reactant prediction.

In this work, we investigate the impact of the training data on a model's performance and robustness for accelerated MRI. We find that models trained on the combination of various data distributions, such as those obtained from different MRI scanners and anatomies, exhibit robustness equal or superior to models trained on the best single distribution for a specific target distribution. Thus training on such diverse data tends to improve robustness. Furthermore, training on such a diverse dataset does not compromise in-distribution performance, i.e., a model trained on diverse data yields in-distribution performance at least as good as models trained on the more narrow individual distributions. Our results suggest that training a model for imaging on a variety of distributions tends to yield a more effective and robust model than maintaining separate models for individual distributions.",

Traditional docking methods are time-consuming, while learning-based approaches supervised by high-precision conformational or affinity labels are limited by the scarcity of training data. Recently, a paradigm of feature alignment through contrastive learning has gained widespread attention. This method does not require explicit binding affinity scores, but it suffers from the issue of overly simplistic construction of negative samples, which limits their generalization to more difficult test cases. In this paper, we propose Drug-TTA, which leverages a large number of self-supervised auxiliary tasks to adapt the model to each test instance. Specifically, we incorporate the auxiliary tasks into both the training and the inference process via meta-learning to improve the performance of the primary task of virtual screening. Additionally, we design a multi-scale feature based Auxiliary Loss Balance Module (ALBM) to balance the auxiliary tasks to improve their efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Drug-TTA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all five virtual screening tasks under a zero-shot setting, showing an average improvement of 9.86\\% in AUROC metric compared to the baseline without test-time adaptation.",

In this work, we robustly remove bias and spurious variation from an automated melanoma classification pipeline using two leading bias unlearning techniques. We show that the biases introduced by surgical markings and rulers presented in previous studies can be reasonably mitigated using these bias removal methods. We also demonstrate the generalisation benefits of unlearning spurious variation relating to the imaging instrument used to capture lesion images. Our experimental results provide evidence that the effects of each of the aforementioned biases are notably reduced, with different debiasing techniques excelling at different tasks.",

However, distribution shifts across data sources and privacy concerns related to sharing individual-level data, coupled with a lack of uncertainty quantification from machine learning predictions, make it challenging to achieve valid inferences in multi-source environments. In this paper, we consider the problem of obtaining distribution-free prediction intervals for a target population, leveraging multiple potentially biased data sources. We derive the efficient influence functions for the quantiles of unobserved outcomes in the target and source populations, and show that one can incorporate machine learning prediction algorithms in the estimation of nuisance functions while still achieving parametric rates of convergence to nominal coverage probabilities. Moreover, when conditional outcome invariance is violated, we propose a data-adaptive strategy to upweight informative data sources for efficiency gain and downweight non-informative data sources for bias reduction. We highlight the robustness and efficiency of our proposals for a variety of conformal scores and data-generating mechanisms via extensive synthetic experiments. Hospital length of stay prediction intervals for pediatric patients undergoing a high-risk cardiac surgical procedure between 2016-2022 in the U.S. illustrate the utility of our methodology.",

However, real-world drug discovery tasks are often characterized by a scarcity of labeled data and significant covariate shift---a setting that poses a challenge to standard deep learning methods. In this paper, we present Q-SAVI, a probabilistic model able to address these challenges by encoding explicit prior knowledge of the data-generating process into a prior distribution over functions, presenting researchers with a transparent and probabilistically principled way to encode data-driven modeling preferences. Building on a novel, gold-standard bioactivity dataset that facilitates a meaningful comparison of models in an extrapolative regime, we explore different approaches to induce data shift and construct a challenging evaluation setup. We then demonstrate that using Q-SAVI to integrate contextualized prior knowledge of drug-like chemical space into the modeling process affords substantial gains in predictive accuracy and calibration, outperforming a broad range of state-of-the-art self-supervised pre-training and domain adaptation techniques.",

To overcome these challenges, we introduce the iDPA framework, which comprises two main components: 1) Instance-level Prompt Generation (IPG), which decouples fine-grained instance-level knowledge from images and generates prompts that focus on dense predictions, and 2) Decoupled Prompt Attention (DPA), which decouples the original prompt attention, enabling a more direct and efficient transfer of prompt information while reducing memory usage and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We collect 13 clinical, cross-modal, multi-organ, and multi-category datasets, referred to as ODinM-13, and experiments demonstrate that iDPA outperforms existing SOTA methods, with FAP improvements of f 5.44%, 4.83%, 12.88%, and 4.59% in full data, 1-shot, 10-shot, and 50-shot settings, respectively.",

Given a query, RAG retrieves relevant documents from a corpus and integrates them into the LLMs\u2019 generation process. In this study, we investigate the adversarial robustness of RAG, focusing specifically on examining the retrieval system. First, across 225 different setup combinations of corpus, retriever, query, and targeted information, we show that retrieval systems are vulnerable to universal poisoning attacks in medical Q&A. In such attacks, adversaries generate poisoned documents containing a broad spectrum of targeted information, such as personally identifiable information. When these poisoned documents are inserted into a corpus, they can be accurately retrieved by any users, as long as attacker-specified queries are used. To understand this vulnerability, we discovered that the deviation from the query\u2019s embedding to that of the poisoned document tends to follow a pattern in which the high similarity between the poisoned document and the query is retained, thereby enabling precise retrieval. Based on these findings, we develop a new detection-based defense to ensure the safe use of RAG. Through extensive experiments spanning various Q&A domains, we observed that our proposed method consistently achieves excellent detection rates in nearly all cases.",

To do this, simple parametric models are frequently used (e.g. coefficients of linear regression) but always fitted on the whole dataset. However, it is common that the covariates may not have a uniform effect over the whole population and thus a unified simple model can miss the heterogeneous signal. For example, a linear model may be able to explain a subset of the data but fail on the rest due to the nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the data. In this paper, we propose DDGroup (data-driven group discovery), a data-driven method to effectively identify subgroups in the data with a uniform linear relationship between the features and the label. DDGroup outputs an interpretable region in which the linear model is expected to hold. It is simple to implement and computationally tractable for use. We show theoretically that, given a large enough sample, DDGroup recovers a region where a single linear model with low variance is well-specified (if one exists), and experiments on real-world medical datasets confirm that it can discover regions where a local linear model has improved performance. Our experiments also show that DDGroup can uncover subgroups with qualitatively different relationships which are missed by simply applying parametric approaches to the whole dataset.",

Existing methods generate molecules from scratch without reference or template ligands, which poses challenges in model optimization and may yield suboptimal outcomes. To address this problem, we propose an innovative interaction-based retrieval-augmented diffusion model named IRDiff to facilitate target-aware molecule generation. IRDiff leverages a curated set of ligand references, i.e., those with desired properties such as high binding affinity, to steer the diffusion model towards synthesizing ligands that satisfy design criteria. Specifically, we utilize a protein-molecule interaction network (PMINet), which is pretrained with binding affinity signals to: (i) retrieve target-aware ligand molecules with high binding affinity to serve as references, and (ii) incorporate essential protein-ligand binding structures for steering molecular diffusion generation with two effective augmentation mechanisms, i.e., retrieval augmentation and self augmentation. Empirical studies on CrossDocked2020 dataset show IRDiff can generate molecules with more realistic 3D structures and achieve state-of-the-art binding affinities towards the protein targets, while maintaining proper molecular properties.

Recent approaches leverage external controls from historical studies or real-world data to strengthen treatment evaluation for survival outcomes. However, using external controls directly may introduce biases due to data heterogeneity. We propose a doubly protected estimator for the treatment-specific restricted mean survival time difference that is more efficient than trial-only estimators and mitigates biases from external data.

It is commonly understood that discount regularization functions by de-emphasizing or ignoring delayed effects. In this paper, we reveal an alternate view of discount regularization that exposes unintended consequences. We demonstrate that planning under a lower discount factor produces an identical optimal policy to planning using any prior on the transition matrix that has the same distribution for all states and actions. In fact, it functions like a prior with stronger regularization on state-action pairs with more transition data. This leads to poor performance when the transition matrix is estimated from data sets with uneven amounts of data across state-action pairs. Our equivalence theorem leads to an explicit formula to set regularization parameters locally for individual state-action pairs rather than globally. We demonstrate the failures of discount regularization and how we remedy them using our state-action-specific method across simple empirical examples as well as a medical cancer simulator.",

Very few studies have been conducted to investigate heterogeneous causal effects (HCEs) in graphical contexts due to the lack of statistical methods. To characterize this heterogeneity, we first conceptualize heterogeneous causal graphs (HCGs) by generalizing the causal graphical model with confounder-based interactions and multiple mediators. Such confounders with an interaction with the treatment are known as moderators. This allows us to flexibly produce HCGs given different moderators and explicitly characterize HCEs from the treatment or potential mediators on the outcome. We establish the theoretical forms of HCEs and derive their properties at the individual level in both linear and nonlinear models. An interactive structural learning is developed to estimate the complex HCGs and HCEs with confidence intervals provided. Our method is empirically justified by extensive simulations and its practical usefulness is illustrated by exploring causality among psychiatric disorders for trauma survivors.

Designing unified screening programs for multiple diseases requires carefully balancing competing disease risks, which is an open problem. In this work, we address this problem by casting unified screening as a referral problem, in which we choose to activate a subset of screening policies for individual diseases by accounting for competing risks that influence patient outcomes. We introduce a novel optimization framework that incorporates disease risks, budget constraints, and diagnostic error limits and characterize the structural properties of the optimal referral policy. For the unified screening of two diseases, we show that the optimal activation threshold for the screening of one disease depends on the risk of the other, resulting in decision boundaries with distinct risk-dependent profiles. We compare our unified model with independent screening programs that apply isolated activation thresholds for screening of each disease. Our approach optimizes screening decisions collectively, improving overall survival outcomes, particularly for patients with high disease risks.",

Using this framework, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art general and medical LLMs from six prominent families: Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, GPT, and DeepSeek. Our findings reveal a significant performance decline as cognitive complexity increases across evaluated models, with model size playing a more critical role in performance at higher cognitive levels.

We argue for a reassessment of applying RL in DTRs, citing concerns such as inconsistent and potentially inconclusive evaluation metrics, the absence of naive and supervised learning baselines, and the diverse choice of RL formulation in existing research. Through a case study with more than 17,000 evaluation experiments using a publicly available Sepsis dataset, we demonstrate that the performance of RL algorithms can significantly vary with changes in evaluation metrics and Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulations. Surprisingly, it is observed that in some instances, RL algorithms can be surpassed by random baselines subjected to policy evaluation methods and reward design. This calls for more careful policy evaluation and algorithm development in future DTR works. Additionally, we discussed potential enhancements toward more reliable development of RL-based dynamic treatment regimes and invited further discussion within the community.

While recent advances in generative models like diffusion models, conditional flow matching, and consistency models achieved impressive results by casting generation as denoising problems, they cannot be directly used for inverse generation without access to clean data. Here we introduce Inverse Flow (IF), a novel framework that enables using these generative models for inverse generation problems including denoising without ground truth. Inverse Flow can be flexibly applied to nearly any continuous noise distribution and allows complex dependencies. We propose two algorithms for learning Inverse Flows, Inverse Flow Matching (IFM) and Inverse Consistency Model (ICM). Notably, to derive the computationally efficient, simulation-free inverse consistency model objective, we generalized consistency training to any forward diffusion processes or conditional flows, which have applications beyond denoising. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IF on synthetic and real datasets, outperforming prior approaches while enabling noise distributions that previous methods cannot support. Finally, we showcase applications of our techniques to fluorescence microscopy and single-cell genomics data, highlighting IF's utility in scientific problems.

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in data-driven decision making is how to quantify the uncertainty of predictions to inform risk-sensitive downstream actions, as often required in domains such as medicine. We develop a decision-theoretic foundation linking prediction sets to risk-averse decision-making, addressing three questions: (1) What is the correct notion of uncertainty quantification for risk-averse decision makers? We prove that prediction sets are optimal for decision makers who wish to optimize their value at risk. (2) What is the optimal policy that a risk averse decision maker should use to map prediction sets to actions? We show that a simple max-min decision policy is optimal for risk-averse decision makers. Finally, (3) How can we derive prediction sets that are optimal for such decision makers? We provide an exact characterization in the population regime and a distribution free finite-sample construction. These insights leads to *Risk-Averse Calibration (RAC)*, a principled algorithm that is both *practical*\u2014exploiting black-box predictions to enhance downstream utility\u2014and *safe*\u2014adhering to user-defined risk thresholds. We experimentally demonstrate RAC's advantages in medical diagnosis and recommendation systems, showing that it substantially improves the trade-off between safety and utility, delivering higher utility than existing methods while avoiding critical errors.",

We introduce Path-Wise Shapley effects (PWSHAP), a framework for assessing the targeted effect of a binary (e.g. treatment) variable from a complex outcome model. Our approach augments the predictive model with a user-defined directed acyclic graph (DAG). The method then uses the graph alongside on-manifold Shapley values to identify effects along causal pathways whilst maintaining robustness to adversarial attacks. We establish error bounds for the identified path-wise Shapley effects and for Shapley values. We show PWSHAP can perform local bias and mediation analyses with faithfulness to the model. Further, if the targeted variable is randomised we can quantify local effect modification. We demonstrate the resolution, interpretability and true locality of our approach on examples and a real-world experiment.",

However, identifying multiple unknown object-level concepts within one scene remains a complex challenge. While recent methods have resorted to cropping or masking individual images to learn multiple concepts, these techniques often require prior knowledge of new concepts and are labour-intensive. To address this challenge, we introduce *Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL)*, where multiple unknown \"words\" are simultaneously learned from a single sentence-image pair, without any imagery annotations. To enhance the accuracy of word-concept correlation and refine attention mask boundaries, we propose three regularisation techniques: *Attention Masking*, *Prompts Contrastive Loss*, and *Bind Adjective*. Extensive quantitative comparisons with both real-world categories and biomedical images demonstrate that our method can learn new semantically disentangled concepts. Our approach emphasises learning solely from textual embeddings, using less than 10% of the storage space compared to others.

Thus there is a distribution shift performance gap for a given neural network, defined as the difference in performance when training on a distribution $P$ and training on another distribution $Q$, and evaluating both models on $Q$. In this work, we propose a domain adaptation method for deep learning based compressive sensing that relies on self-supervision during training paired with test-time training at inference.

However, in real-world molecular discovery, the oracle is often represented by wet-lab experiments, making this online setting impractical due to the significant time and resource demands. To fill this gap, we propose the Molecular Stitching (MolStitch) framework, which utilizes a fixed offline dataset to explore and optimize molecules without the need for repeated oracle evaluations. Specifically, MolStitch leverages existing molecules from the offline dataset to generate novel `stitched molecules' that combine their desirable properties. These stitched molecules are then used as training samples to fine-tune the generative model using preference optimization techniques. Experimental results on various offline multi-objective molecular optimization problems validate the effectiveness of MolStitch. The source code is available online.",

To address this, we propose a *distributionally robust data valuation* approach to perform data valuation without known/fixed validation distributions. Our approach defines the value of data by its improvement of the distributionally robust generalization error (DRGE), thus providing a worst-case performance guarantee *without* a known/fixed validation distribution. However, since computing DRGE directly is infeasible, we propose using *model deviation* as a proxy for the marginal improvement of DRGE (for kernel regression and neural networks) to compute data values. Furthermore, we identify a notion of uniqueness where low uniqueness characterizes low-value data. We empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing data valuation approaches in data selection and data removal tasks on real-world datasets (e.g., housing price prediction, diabetes hospitalization prediction).",

However, this process generates many tokens, which leads to high memory requirements for computing attention and complicates post-hoc interpretability analyses. Instead, we hypothesize that we can: (1) effectively summarize the morphological content of a WSI by condensing its constituting tokens using morphological prototypes, achieving more than $300\\times$ compression; and (2) accurately characterize cellular functions by encoding the transcriptomic profile with biological pathway prototypes, all in an unsupervised fashion. The resulting multimodal tokens are then processed by a fusion network, either with a Transformer or an optimal transport cross-alignment, which now operates with a small and fixed number of tokens without approximations.

We address a neglected yet non-negligible computational challenge of MIL in the context of DAM, i.e., bag size is too large to be loaded into GPU memory for backpropagation, which is required by the standard pooling methods of MIL. To tackle this challenge, we propose variance-reduced stochastic pooling methods in the spirit of stochastic optimization by formulating the loss function over the pooled prediction as a multi-level compositional function. By synthesizing techniques from stochastic compositional optimization and non-convex min-max optimization, we propose a unified and provable muli-instance DAM (MIDAM) algorithm with stochastic smoothed-max pooling or stochastic attention-based pooling, which only samples a few instances for each bag to compute a stochastic gradient estimator and to update the model parameter. We establish a similar convergence rate of the proposed MIDAM algorithm as the state-of-the-art DAM algorithms. Our extensive experiments on conventional MIL datasets and medical datasets demonstrate the superiority of our MIDAM algorithm. The method is open-sourced at https://libauc.org/.",

This paper explores a sequence-only scenario for affinity maturation, using solely antibody and antigen sequences. Recently AlphaFlow wraps AlphaFold within flow matching to generate diverse protein structures, enabling a sequence-conditioned generative model of structure. Building on this, we propose an \\textit{alternating optimization} framework that (1) fixes the sequence to guide structure generation toward high binding affinity using a structure-based predictor, then (2) applies inverse folding to create sequence mutations, refined by a sequence-based predictor. A key challenge is the lack of labeled data for training both predictors. To address this, we develop a \\textit{co-teaching} module that incorporates valuable information from noisy biophysical energies into predictor refinement. The sequence-based predictor selects consensus samples to teach the structure-based predictor, and vice versa. Our method, \\textit{AffinityFlow}, achieves state-of-the-art performance in proof-of-concept affinity maturation experiments.",

An Amino Acid Knowledge Graph (AAKG) is constructed to represent the intricate biochemical relationships among amino acids. We further propose a Protein Language Model (PLM)-based policy network that iteratively samples mutants through preferential random walks on the AAKG using a dynamic sliding window mechanism. The novel mutants are actively sampled to fine-tune a fitness predictor as the reward model, providing feedback to the knowledge-aware policy. Finally, we optimize the whole system in an active learning approach that mimics biological settings in practice.KnowRLM stands out for its ability to utilize contextual amino acid information from knowledge graphs, thus attaining advantages from both statistical patterns of protein sequences and biochemical properties of amino acids.Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of KnowRLM in more efficiently identifying high-fitness mutants compared to existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies comprise the most versatile class of binding molecules, with numerous applications in biomedicine. Computational design of antibodies involves generating novel and diverse sequences, while maintaining structural consistency. Unique to antibodies, designing the complementarity-determining region (CDR), which determines the antigen binding affinity and specificity, creates its own unique challenges. Recent deep learning models have shown impressive results, however the limited number of known antibody sequence/structure pairs frequently leads to degraded performance, particularly lacking diversity in the generated sequences. In our work we address this challenge by leveraging Model Reprogramming (MR), which repurposes pretrained models on a source language to adapt to the tasks that are in a different language and have scarce data - where it may be difficult to train a high-performing model from scratch or effectively fine-tune an existing pre-trained model on the specific task. Specifically, we introduce ReprogBert in which a pretrained English language model is repurposed for protein sequence infilling - thus considers cross-language adaptation using less data. Results on antibody design benchmarks show that our model on low-resourced antibody sequence dataset provides highly diverse CDR sequences, up to more than a two-fold increase of diversity over the baselines, without losing structural integrity and naturalness. The generated sequences also demonstrate enhanced antigen binding specificity and virus neutralization ability. Code is available at https://github.com/IBM/ReprogBERT",

Our evaluation of current large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows limited performance on this benchmark, highlighting both the challenges of the task and the importance of this benchmark for advancing medical AI. Furthermore, we propose a novel ``Clinical Graph of Thoughts\" model, which integrates domain-specific medical knowledge and clinical reasoning processes with the interpretive abilities of LVLMs. The model demonstrates promising results, achieving around 15\\% absolute gain on the most important neurocognitive outcome task, while the benchmark still reveals substantial opportunities for further research innovation.",

Recently, PnP has achieved great empirical success, especially with the integration of deep learning-based denoisers. However, a key problem of PnP based approaches is that they require manual parameter tweaking. It is necessary to obtain high-quality results across the high discrepancy in terms of imaging conditions and varying scene content. In this work, we present a tuning-free PnP proximal algorithm, which can automatically determine the internal parameters including the penalty parameter, the denoising strength and the terminal time. A key part of our approach is to develop a policy network for automatic search of parameters, which can be effectively learned via mixed model-free and model-based deep reinforcement learning. We demonstrate, through numerical and visual experiments, that the learned policy can customize different parameters for different states, and often more efficient and effective than existing handcrafted criteria. Moreover, we discuss the practical considerations of the plugged denoisers, which together with our learned policy yield state-of-the-art results. This is prevalent on both linear and nonlinear exemplary inverse imaging problems, and in particular, we show promising results on Compressed Sensing MRI and phase retrieval.",

However, most molecules are not static and at room temperature adopt a wide variety of geometries or $\\textit{conformations}$. The resulting distribution on geometries $p(x)$ is known as the Boltzmann distribution, and many molecular properties are expectations computed under this distribution. Generating accurate samples from the Boltzmann distribution is therefore essential for computing these expectations accurately. Traditional sampling-based methods are computationally expensive, and most recent machine learning-based methods have focused on identifying $\\textit{modes}$ in this distribution rather than generating true $\\textit{samples}$. Generating such samples requires capturing conformational variability, and it has been widely recognized that the majority of conformational variability in molecules arises from rotatable bonds. In this work, we present VonMisesNet, a new graph neural network that captures conformational variability via a variational approximation of rotatable bond torsion angles as a mixture of von Mises distributions. We demonstrate that VonMisesNet can generate conformations for arbitrary molecules in a way that is both physically accurate with respect to the Boltzmann distribution and orders of magnitude faster than existing sampling methods.",

However, current approaches to spectrum prediction model the output space in ways that force a tradeoff between capturing high resolution mass information and tractable learning. We resolve this tradeoff by casting spectrum prediction as a mapping from an input molecular graph to a probability distribution over chemical formulas. We further discover that a large corpus of mass spectra can be closely approximated using a fixed vocabulary constituting only 2% of all observed formulas. This enables efficient spectrum prediction using an architecture similar to graph classification - GrAFF-MS - achieving significantly lower prediction error and greater retrieval accuracy than previous approaches.",

When instances are observed irregularly over time, sampling times are typically not random, but rather informative\u2013depending on the instance's characteristics, past outcomes, and administered treatments. In this work, we formalize informative sampling as a covariate shift problem and show that it can prohibit accurate estimation of treatment outcomes if not properly accounted for. To overcome this challenge, we present a general framework for learning treatment outcomes in the presence of informative sampling using inverse intensity-weighting, and propose a novel method, TESAR-CDE, that instantiates this framework using Neural CDEs.

We propose Multi-Objective GFlowNets (MOGFNs), a novel method for generating diverse Pareto optimal solutions, based on GFlowNets.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss feature engineering for single-pass uncertainty estimation. For accurate uncertainty estimates, neural networks must extract differences in the feature space that quantify uncertainty. This could be achieved by current single-pass approaches that maintain feature distances between data points as they traverse the network. While initial results are promising, maintaining feature distances within the network representations frequently inhibits information compression and opposes the learning objective. We study this effect theoretically and empirically to arrive at a simple conclusion: preserving feature distances in the output is beneficial when the preserved features contribute to learning the label distribution and act in opposition otherwise. We then propose Transitional Uncertainty with Layered Intermediate Predictions (TULIP) as a simple approach to address the shortcomings of current single-pass estimators. Specifically, we implement feature preservation by extracting features from intermediate representations before information is collapsed by subsequent layers. We refer to the underlying preservation mechanism as transitional feature preservation. We show that TULIP matches or outperforms current single-pass methods on standard benchmarks and in practical settings where these methods are less reliable (imbalances, complex architectures, medical modalities).",

While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an order-policy, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the exact log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation.

In this work, we focus on a new type of drug design problem \u2014 generating a small \u201clinker\u201d to physically attach two independent molecules with their distinct functions. The main computational challenges include: 1) the generation of linkers is conditional on the two given molecules, in contrast to generating complete molecules from scratch in previous works; 2) linkers heavily depend on the anchor atoms of the two molecules to be connected, which are not known beforehand; 3) 3D structures and orientations of the molecules need to be considered to avoid atom clashes, for which equivariance to E(3) group are necessary. To address these problems, we propose a conditional generative model, named 3DLinker, which is able to predict anchor atoms and jointly generate linker graphs and their 3D structures based on an E(3) equivariant graph variational autoencoder. So far as we know, no previous models could achieve this task.

While influenza epidemics occur every year, timing and size of the epidemic vary strongly from season to season. This complicates the public health efforts to adequately respond to such epidemics. Forecasting techniques to predict the development of seasonal epidemics such as influenza, are of great help to public health decision making. Therefore, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has initiated a yearly challenge to forecast influenza-like illness. Here, we propose a new framework based on Gaussian process (GP) for seasonal epidemics forecasting and demonstrate its capability on the CDC reference data on influenza like illness: our framework leads to accurate forecasts with small but reliable uncertainty estimation. We compare our framework to several state of the art benchmarks and show competitive performance. We, therefore, believe that our GP based framework for seasonal epidemics forecasting will play a key role for future influenza forecasting and, lead to further research in the area.",

The proposed method can generate high-quality Pre-Contrast images, thus, enabling comprehensive diagnostics while reducing the need for additional imaging sessions, costs, and patient risks.

To evaluate generative models it is important to accurately measure differences between high-dimensional distributions. In this paper we propose the ``KSD-B'', a novel divergence measure for distributions over biological sequences that is based on the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD). The KSD-B can be evaluated even when the normalizing constant of the model is unknown; it allows for variable length sequences and can take into account biological notions of sequence distance. Unlike previous KSDs over discrete spaces the KSD-B (a) is theoretically guaranteed to detect convergence and non-convergence of distributions over sequence space and (b) can be efficiently estimated in practice. We demonstrate the advantages of the KSD-B on problems with synthetic and real data, and apply it to measure the fit of state-of-the-art machine learning models. Overall, the KSD-B enables rigorous evaluation of generative biological sequence models, allowing the accuracy of models, sampling procedures, and library designs to be checked reliably.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Contrastive learning has gained prominence in fields such as vision, and biology, leveraging predefined positive/negative samples for representation learning. Data augmentation, categorized into hand-designed and model-based methods, has been identified as a crucial component for enhancing contrastive learning. However, hand-designed methods require human expertise in domain-specific data while sometimes distorting the meaning of the data. In contrast, generative model-based approaches usually require supervised or large-scale external data, which has become a bottleneck constraining model training in many domains. To address the problems presented above, this paper proposes DiffAug, a novel unsupervised contrastive learning technique with diffusion mode-based positive data generation. DiffAug consists of a semantic encoder and a conditional diffusion model; the conditional diffusion model generates new positive samples conditioned on the semantic encoding to serve the training of unsupervised contrast learning. With the help of iterative training of the semantic encoder and diffusion model, DiffAug improves the representation ability in an uninterrupted and unsupervised manner. Experimental evaluations show that DiffAug outperforms hand-designed and SOTA model-based augmentation methods on DNA sequence, visual, and bio-feature datasets. The code for review is released at [DiffAug CODE](https://github.com/zangzelin/code_diffaug).",

We use MambaDNA as the basis of Caduceus, the first family of RC equivariant bi-directional long-range DNA language models, and we introduce pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that yield Caduceus DNA foundation models. Caduceus outperforms previous long-range models on downstream benchmarks; on a challenging long-range variant effect prediction task, Caduceus exceeds the performance of 10x larger models that do not leverage bi-directionality or equivariance.

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a surge of interest in extending the success of large language models (LLMs) from texts to molecules. Most existing approaches adopt a graph neural network to represent a molecule as a series of node tokens for molecule-language alignment, which, however, have overlooked the inherent hierarchical structures in molecules. Notably, higher-order molecular structures contain rich semantics of functional groups, which encode crucial biochemical functionalities of the molecules. We show that neglecting the hierarchical information in tokenization will lead to subpar molecule-language alignment and severe hallucination. To address this limitation, we propose HIerarchical GrapH Tokenization (HIGHT). HIGHT employs a hierarchical graph tokenizer that encodes the hierarchy of atom, motif, and molecular levels of informative tokens to improve the molecular perception of LLMs. HIGHT also adopts an augmented instruction tuning dataset, enriched with the hierarchical graph information, to further enhance the molecule-language alignment. Extensive experiments on 14 real-world benchmarks verify the effectiveness of HIGHT in reducing hallucination by 40%, and significant improvements in various molecule-language downstream tasks.

One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional *de novo* generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on *de novo* molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size.

However, when utilizing the attention of ViT as evidence in high-stakes decision-making tasks such as medical diagnostics, a challenge arises due to the potential of attention mechanisms erroneously focusing on irrelevant regions. In this study, we propose a statistical test for ViT's attentions, enabling us to use the attentions as reliable quantitative evidence indicators for ViT's decision-making with a rigorously controlled error rate. Using the framework called selective inference, we quantify the statistical significance of attentions in the form of p-values, which enables the theoretically grounded quantification of the false positive detection probability of attentions.

    "abstract": "RNA properties, such as function and stability, are intricately tied to their two-dimensional conformations. This has spurred the development of computational models for predicting the RNA secondary structures, leveraging dynamic programming or machine learning (ML) techniques. These structures are governed by specific rules; for example, only Watson-Crick and Wobble pairs are allowed, and sequences must not form sharp bends. Recent efforts introduced a systematic approach to post-process the predictions made by ML algorithms, aiming to modify them to respect the constraints. However, we still observe instances violating the requirements, significantly reducing biological relevance. To address this challenge, we present a novel post-processing framework for ML-based predictions on RNA secondary structures, inspired by the assignment problem in integer linear programming. Our algorithm offers a theoretical guarantee, ensuring that the resulting predictions adhere to the fundamental constraints of RNAs. Empirical evidence supports the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating improved predictive performance with no constraint violation, while requiring less running time.",

Traditional measures such as confidence intervals may be insufficient due to noise, limited data and confounding. In this paper we develop a method that could serve as a hybrid human-AI system, to enable human experts to analyze the validity of policy evaluation estimates. This is accomplished by highlighting observations in the data whose removal will have a large effect on the OPE estimate, and formulating a set of rules for choosing which ones to present to domain experts for validation. We develop methods to compute exactly the influence functions for fitted Q-evaluation with two different function classes: kernel-based and linear least squares, as well as importance sampling methods.

The binding affinity is governed by the 3D binding interface where antibody residues (paratope) closely interact with antigen residues (epitope). Thus, the key question of antibody design is how to predict the 3D paratope-epitope complex (i.e., docking) for paratope generation. In this paper, we propose a new model called Hierarchical Structure Refinement Network (HSRN) for paratope docking and design. During docking, HSRN employs a hierarchical message passing network to predict atomic forces and use them to refine a binding complex in an iterative, equivariant manner. During generation, its autoregressive decoder progressively docks generated paratopes and builds a geometric representation of the binding interface to guide the next residue choice. Our results show that HSRN significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art on paratope docking and design benchmarks.",

Recent approaches augment support for controlling soft, differentiable properties but they fail to handle user-specified hard constraints that are non-differentiable. This often results in vague control, unsuitable for applications like drug discovery that demand satisfaction of precise constraints, e.g., the maximum number of bonds. To address this, we formalize the problem of controlled graph generation and introduce PRODIGY (PROjected DIffusion for controlled Graph Generation), an innovative plug-and-play approach enabling the generation of graphs with precise control, from any pre-trained diffusion model. PRODIGY employs a novel operator to project the samples at each diffusion step onto the specified constrained space. For a large class of practical constraints and a variety of graphs, our extensive experiments demonstrate that PRODIGY empowers state-of-the-art continuous and discrete diffusion models to produce graphs meeting specific, hard constraints. Our approach achieves up to 100% constraint satisfaction for non-attributed and molecular graphs, under a variety of constraints, marking a significant step forward in precise, interpretable graph generation.

We provide a simple optimization algorithm compatible with deep neural networks to satisfy these constraints. Since our method does not require test-time access to sensitive attributes, it can be applied to reduce worst-case classification errors between outcomes in unbalanced classification problems.

There are two major defects in current learning-based methods: 1) tackling only a certain subtask of the whole antibody design pipeline, making them suboptimal or resource-intensive. 2) omitting either the framework regions or side chains, thus incapable of capturing the full-atom geometry. To address these pitfalls, we propose dynamic Multi-channel Equivariant grAph Network (dyMEAN), an end-to-end full-atom model for E(3)-equivariant antibody design given the epitope and the incomplete sequence of the antibody. Specifically, we first explore structural initialization as a knowledgeable guess of the antibody structure and then propose shadow paratope to bridge the epitope-antibody connections. Both 1D sequences and 3D structures are updated via an adaptive multi-channel equivariant encoder that is able to process protein residues of variable sizes when considering full atoms. Finally, the updated antibody is docked to the epitope via the alignment of the shadow paratope. Experiments on epitope-binding CDR-H3 design, complex structure prediction, and affinity optimization demonstrate the superiority of our end-to-end framework and full-atom modeling.",

We augment DMs with learnable discrete latents, inferred with an encoder, and train DM and encoder end-to-end. DisCo-Diff does not rely on pre-trained networks, making the framework universally applicable. The discrete latents significantly simplify learning the DM's complex noise-to-data mapping by reducing the curvature of the DM's generative ODE. An additional autoregressive transformer models the distribution of the discrete latents, a simple step because DisCo-Diff requires only few discrete variables with small codebooks. We validate DisCo-Diff on toy data, several image synthesis tasks as well as molecular docking, and find that introducing discrete latents consistently improves model performance. For example, DisCo-Diff achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on class-conditioned ImageNet-64/128 datasets with ODE sampler.",

However, its application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.",

    "abstract": "Standard conformal prediction ensures marginal coverage but consistently undercovers underrepresented groups, limiting its reliability for fair uncertainty quantification. Group fairness requires prediction sets to achieve a user-specified coverage level within each protected group. While group-wise conformal inference meets this requirement, it often produces excessively wide prediction sets due to limited sample sizes in underrepresented groups, highlighting a fundamental tradeoff between fairness and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we introduce Surrogate-Assisted Group-Clustered Conformal Inference (SAGCCI), a framework that improves efficiency through two key innovations: (1) clustering protected groups with similar conformal score distributions to enhance precision while maintaining fairness, and (2) deriving an efficient influence function that optimally integrates surrogate outcomes to construct tighter prediction sets. Theoretically, SAGCCI guarantees approximate group-conditional coverage in a doubly robust manner under mild convergence conditions, enabling flexible nuisance model estimation. Empirically, through simulations and an analysis of the phase 3 Moderna COVE COVID-19 vaccine trial, we demonstrate that SAGCCI outperforms existing methods, producing narrower prediction sets while maintaining valid group-conditional coverage, effectively balancing fairness and efficiency in uncertainty quantification.",

We show that CoMP has attractive theoretical properties compared to previous approaches, and we prove counterfactual identifiability of CoMP under additional assumptions.

We propose Foundation Molecular Grammar (FMG), which leverages multi-modal foundation models (MMFMs) to induce an interpretable molecular language. By exploiting the chemical knowledge of an MMFM, FMG renders molecules as images, describes them as text, and aligns information across modalities using prompt learning. FMG can be used as a drop-in replacement for the prior grammar learning approaches in molecular generation and property prediction. We show that FMG not only excels in synthesizability, diversity, and data efficiency but also offers built-in chemical interpretability for automated molecular discovery workflows.

Gini regularization is applied to the weights of the output layer and constrains the number of dimensions the model can use to make predictions. We show that Gini and BRO regularization can improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art GCNN attribution methods on artificial benchmark datasets.

In this paper, we propose improved FDAM algorithms for heterogeneous data by solving the popular non-convex strongly-concave min-max formulation of DAM in a distributed fashion, which can also be applied to a class of non-convex strongly-concave min-max problems. A striking result of this paper is that the communication complexity of the proposed algorithm is a constant independent of the number of machines and also independent of the accuracy level, which improves an existing result by orders of magnitude. The experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our FDAM algorithm on benchmark datasets, and on medical chest X-ray images from different organizations.

Therefore, it becomes essential to actively incorporate more high-quality labeled data, all while adhering to a constrained labeling budget. To enable data-efficient treatment effect estimation, we formalize the problem through rigorous theoretical analysis within the active learning context, where the derived key measures -- factual and counterfactual covering radii determine the risk upper bound. To reduce the bound, we propose a greedy radius reduction algorithm, which excels under an idealized, balanced data distribution. To generalize to more realistic data distributions, we further propose FCCM, which transforms the optimization objective into the Factual and Counterfactual Coverage Maximization to ensure effective radius reduction during data acquisition. Furthermore, benchmarking FCCM against other baselines demonstrates its superiority across both fully synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets. Code: https://github.com/uqhwen2/FCCM.",

However, one of the main limitations of existing methods is their large output space, which limits generation scalability and hinders accurate modeling of the underlying distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that significantly reduces the output space of existing graph generative models. Specifically, starting from the observation that many real-world graphs have low graph bandwidth, we restrict graph bandwidth during training and generation. Our strategy improves both generation scalability and quality without increasing architectural complexity or reducing expressiveness. Our approach is compatible with existing graph generative methods, and we describe its application to both autoregressive and one-shot models. We extensively validate our strategy on synthetic and real datasets, including molecular graphs. Our experiments show that, in addition to improving generation efficiency, our approach consistently improves generation quality and reconstruction accuracy. The implementation is made available.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces diffusion protein language model (DPLM), a versatile protein language model that demonstrates strong generative and predictive capabilities for protein sequences. We first pre-train scalable DPLMs from evolutionary-scale protein sequences within a generative self-supervised discrete diffusion probabilistic framework, which generalizes language modeling for proteins in a principled way. After pre-training, DPLM exhibits the ability to generate structurally plausible, novel and diverse protein sequences for unconditional generation. We further demonstrate the proposed diffusion generative pre-training make DPLM possess a better understanding of proteins, making it a superior representation learner, which can be fine-tuned for various predictive tasks, comparing favorably to ESM2. Moreover, DPLM can be tailored for various needs, which showcases its prowess of conditional generation in several ways: (1) conditioning on partial peptide sequences, e.g., generating scaffolds for functional motifs with high success rate; (2) incorporating other modalities as conditioners, e.g., structure-conditioned generation for inverse folding; and (3) steering sequence generation towards desired properties, e.g., satisfying specified secondary structures, through a plug-and-play classifier guidance.",

Existing large language models (LLMS) can achieve high token matching scores in terms of likelihood for molecule generation. However, relying solely on LLM decoding often results in the generation of molecules that are either invalid due to a single misused token, or suboptimal due to unbalanced exploration and exploitation as a consequence of the LLM\u2019s prior experience. Here we propose ERP, Entropy-Reinforced Planning for Transformer Decoding, which employs an entropy-reinforced planning algorithm to enhance the Transformer decoding process and strike a balance between exploitation and exploration. ERP aims to achieve improvements in multiple properties compared to direct sampling from the Transformer. We evaluated ERP on the SARS-CoV-2 virus (3CLPro) and human cancer cell target protein (RTCB) benchmarks and demonstrated that, in both benchmarks, ERP consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithm by 1-5 percent, and baselines by 5-10 percent, respectively. Moreover, such improvement is robust across Transformer models trained with different objectives. Finally, to further illustrate the capabilities of ERP, we tested our algorithm on three code generation benchmarks and outperformed the current state-of-the-art approach as well.

Existing methods are confined to the single-subject paradigm due to substantial brain variability, which leads to weak generalization across individuals and incurs high training costs, exacerbated by limited availability of fMRI data. To address these challenges, we propose MindAligner, an explicit functional alignment framework for cross-subject brain decoding from limited fMRI data. The proposed MindAligner enjoys several merits. First, we learn a Brain Transfer Matrix (BTM) that projects the brain signals of an arbitrary new subject to one of the known subjects, enabling seamless use of pre-trained decoding models. Second, to facilitate reliable BTM learning, a Brain Functional Alignment module is proposed to perform soft cross-subject brain alignment under different visual stimuli with a multi-level brain alignment loss, uncovering fine-grained functional correspondences with high interpretability. Experiments indicate that MindAligner not only outperforms existing methods in visual decoding under data-limited conditions, but also provides valuable neuroscience insights in cross-subject functional analysis.

However, real-world data collected across different modalities is often not paired, which is a significant challenge to learn a joint distribution. A prominent approach to address the modality coupling problem is Minimum Entropy Coupling (MEC), which seeks to minimize the joint Entropy, while satisfying constraints on the marginals. Existing approaches to the MEC problem focus on finite, discrete distributions, limiting their application for cases involving continuous data. In this work, we propose a novel method to solve the continuous MEC problem, using well-known generative diffusion models that learn to approximate and minimize the joint Entropy through a cooperative scheme, while satisfying a relaxed version of the marginal constraints.\nWe empirically demonstrate that our method, DDMEC, is general and can be easily used to address challenging tasks, including unsupervised single-cell multi-omics data alignment and unpaired image translation, outperforming specialized methods.",

Bayesian optimization (BO) is an essential part of such workflows, enabling scientists to leverage prior domain knowledge into efficient exploration of a large molecular space. While such prior knowledge can take many forms, there has been significant fanfare around the ancillary scientific knowledge encapsulated in large language models (LLMs). However, existing work thus far has only explored LLMs for heuristic materials searches. Indeed, recent work obtains the uncertainty estimate---an integral part of BO---from point-estimated, _non-Bayesian_ LLMs. In this work, we study the question of whether LLMs are actually useful to accelerate principled _Bayesian_ optimization in the molecular space. We take a sober, dispassionate stance in answering this question. This is done by carefully (i) viewing LLMs as fixed feature extractors for standard but principled BO surrogate models and by (ii) leveraging parameter-efficient finetuning methods and Bayesian neural networks to obtain the posterior of the LLM surrogate. Our extensive experiments with real-world chemistry problems show that LLMs can be useful for BO over molecules, but only if they have been pretrained or finetuned with domain-specific data.",

    "abstract": "Foundation models trained on patient electronic health records (EHRs) require tokenizing medical data into sequences of discrete vocabulary items. Existing tokenizers treat medical codes from EHRs as isolated textual tokens. However, each medical code is defined by its textual description, its position in ontological hierarchies, and its relationships to other codes, such as disease co-occurrences and drug-treatment associations. Medical vocabularies contain more than 600,000 codes with critical information for clinical reasoning.  We introduce MedTok, a multimodal medical code tokenizer that uses the text descriptions and relational context of codes. MedTok processes text using a language model encoder and encodes the relational structure with a graph encoder. It then quantizes both modalities into a unified token space, preserving modality-specific and cross-modality information.  We integrate MedTok into five EHR models and evaluate it on operational and clinical tasks across in-patient and out-patient datasets, including outcome prediction, diagnosis classification, drug recommendation, and risk stratification. Swapping standard EHR tokenizers with MedTok improves AUPRC across all EHR models, by 4.10% on MIMIC-III, 4.78% on MIMIC-IV, and 11.32% on EHRShot, with the largest gains in drug recommendation. Beyond EHR modeling, we demonstrate using MedTok tokenizer with medical QA systems. Our results demonstrate the potential of MedTok as a unified tokenizer for medical codes, improving tokenization for medical foundation models.",

Based on ideas from conformal inference and distributionally robust learning, we present an algorithm that outputs (approximately) valid and efficient prediction intervals in the presence of distributional shifts.

A primary drawback to this three-step procedure is that each step is carried out independently, thereby neglecting the effects of the nonlinear embedding and inter-gene dependencies on the selection of marker genes. Here we propose an integrated deep learning framework, Adversarial Clustering Explanation (ACE), that bundles all three steps into a single workflow. The method thus moves away from the notion of \"marker genes\" to instead identify a panel of explanatory genes. This panel may include genes that are not only enriched but also depleted relative to other cell types, as well as genes that exhibit differences between closely related cell types. Empirically, we demonstrate that ACE is able to identify gene panels that are both highly discriminative and nonredundant, and we demonstrate the applicability of ACE to an image recognition task.",

Although diffusion models have achieved notable success in graph generation recently, they are ill-suited for modeling the topological properties of graphs since learning to denoise the noisy samples does not explicitly learn the graph structures to be generated. To tackle this limitation, we propose a generative framework that models the topology of graphs by explicitly learning the final graph structures of the diffusion process. Specifically, we design the generative process as a mixture of endpoint-conditioned diffusion processes which is driven toward the predicted graph that results in rapid convergence. We further introduce a simple parameterization of the mixture process and develop an objective for learning the final graph structure, which enables maximum likelihood training. Through extensive experimental validation on general graph and 2D/3D molecule generation tasks, we show that our method outperforms previous generative models, generating graphs with correct topology with both continuous (e.g. 3D coordinates) and discrete (e.g. atom types) features.

A 3D (geometric) representation of a molecule is called a conformer and consists of its atom types and Cartesian coordinates. Every conformer has a potential energy, and the lower this energy, the more likely it occurs in nature. Most existing machine learning methods for molecular property prediction consider either 2D molecular graphs or 3D conformer structure representations in isolation. Inspired by recent work on using ensembles of conformers in conjunction with 2D graph representations, we propose E(3)-invariant molecular conformer aggregation networks. The method integrates a molecule\u2019s 2D representation with that of multiple of its conformers. Contrary to prior work, we propose a novel 2D\u20133D aggregation mechanism based on a differentiable solver for the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Barycenter problem and the use of an efficient conformer generation method based on distance geometry. We show that the proposed aggregation mechanism is E(3) invariant and propose an efficient GPU implementation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the aggregation mechanism helps to significantly outperform state-of-the-art molecule property prediction methods on established datasets.",

We discover a surprisingly tight connection between a popular class of neural networks (binary-weight ReLU aka BinaryConnect) and a class of coupled chemical reactions that are absolutely robust to reaction rates. The robustness of rate-independent chemical computation makes it a promising target for bioengineering implementation. We show how a BinaryConnect neural network trained in silico using well-founded deep learning optimization techniques, can be compiled to an equivalent chemical reaction network, providing a novel molecular programming paradigm. We illustrate such translation on the paradigmatic IRIS and MNIST datasets.

The location of the pattern within input samples is usually determined by a pre-defined mask *shared across all samples*. In this paper, we show that the shared mask potentially limits VR's generalization and increases its approximation error due to the lack of sample-level adaptation. Motivated by this finding, we design a new framework for VR called *sample-specific multi-channel masks* (SMM). Specifically, SMM employs a lightweight ConvNet and patch-wise interpolation to generate sample-specific three-channel masks instead of a shared and pre-defined mask. Since we generate different masks for individual samples, SMM is theoretically shown to reduce approximation error for the target tasks compared with existing state-of-the-art VR methods. We also empirically demonstrate its performance gain on both ResNet and ViT. The success of SMM further highlights the broader applicability of VR in leveraging the latent knowledge of pre-trained models for various target tasks.

However, therapy-induced selective pressures drive the emergence of new viral strains, against which the original myopic therapies are no longer effective. This evolutionary response presents an opportunity: our therapies could both *defend against and actively influence viral evolution*. This motivates our method ADIOS: Antibody Development vIa Opponent Shaping. ADIOS is a meta-learning framework where the process of antibody therapy design, the *outer loop*, accounts for the virus's adaptive response, the *inner loop*. With ADIOS, antibodies are not only robust against potential future variants, they also influence, i.e. *shape*, which future variants emerge. In line with the opponent shaping literature, we refer to our optimised antibodies as *shapers*. To demonstrate the value of ADIOS, we build a viral evolution simulator using the Absolut! framework, in which shapers successfully target both current and future viral variants, outperforming myopic antibodies. Furthermore, we show that shapers modify the distribution over viral evolutionary trajectories to result in weaker variants.\nWe believe that our ADIOS paradigm will facilitate the discovery of long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies while also generalising to other domains. Specifically, domains such as antimicrobial resistance, cancer treatment, and others with evolutionarily adaptive opponents. Our code is available at https://github.com/olakalisz/adios.",

However, the performance of current deep learning-based methods is limited by the inherent complexity of mass spectrometry data and the heterogeneous distribution of noise signals, leading to data-specific biases. We present RankNovo, the first deep reranking framework that enhances de novo peptide sequencing by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple sequencing models. RankNovo employs a list-wise reranking approach, modeling candidate peptides as multiple sequence alignments and utilizing axial attention to extract informative features across candidates. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics, PMD (**P**eptide **M**ass **D**eviation) and RMD (**R**esidual**M**ass **D**eviation), which offer delicate supervision by quantifying mass differences between peptides at both the sequence and residue levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RankNovo not only surpasses its base models used to generate training candidates for reranking pre-training, but also sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark. Moreover, RankNovo exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen models\u2014those whose generations were not exposed during training, highlighting its robustness and potential as a universal reranking framework for peptide sequencing. Our work presents a novel reranking strategy that fundamentally challenges existing single-model paradigms and advances the frontier of accurate de novo sequencing.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models are the standard toolkit for generative modelling of 3D atomic systems. However, for different types of atomic systems -- such as molecules and materials -- the generative processes are usually highly specific to the target system despite the underlying physics being the same. We introduce the All-atom Diffusion Transformer (ADiT), a unified latent diffusion framework for jointly generating both periodic materials and non-periodic molecular systems using the same model: (1) An autoencoder maps a unified, all-atom representations of molecules and materials to a shared latent embedding space; and (2) A diffusion model is trained to generate new latent embeddings that the autoencoder can decode to sample new molecules or materials. Experiments on MP20, QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets demonstrate that jointly trained ADiT generates realistic and valid molecules as well as materials, obtaining state-of-the-art results on par with molecule and crystal-specific models. ADiT uses standard Transformers with minimal inductive biases for both the autoencoder and diffusion model, resulting in significant speedups during training and inference compared to equivariant diffusion models. Scaling ADiT up to half a billion parameters predictably improves performance, representing a step towards broadly generalizable foundation models for generative chemistry.

However, little is known about its statistical properties, and thus, we are not certain about whether this performance estimate is reliable or not. We theoretically investigate this evaluation methodology and show that it potentially suffers from two biases; one is due to misspecification of the predictor and the other to reusing the same finite sample for training and evaluation.

Protein language models studied to date have been trained to perform inference from individual sequences. The longstanding approach in computational biology has been to make inferences from a family of evolutionarily related sequences by fitting a model to each family independently. In this work we combine the two paradigms. We introduce a protein language model which takes as input a set of sequences in the form of a multiple sequence alignment. The model interleaves row and column attention across the input sequences and is trained with a variant of the masked language modeling objective across many protein families. The performance of the model surpasses current state-of-the-art unsupervised structure learning methods by a wide margin, with far greater parameter efficiency than prior state-of-the-art protein language models.",

Instruments are variables which only affect the outcome indirectly via the treatment variable(s). Most IV applications focus on low-dimensional treatments and crucially require at least as many instruments as treatments. This assumption is restrictive: in the natural sciences we often seek to infer causal effects of high-dimensional treatments (e.g., the effect of gene expressions or microbiota on health and disease), but can only run few experiments with a limited number of instruments (e.g., drugs or antibiotics). In such under-specified problems, the full treatment effect is not identifiable in a single experiment even in the linear case. We show that one can still reliably recover the projection of the treatment effect onto the instrumented subspace and develop techniques to consistently combine such partial estimates from different sets of instruments. We then leverage our combined estimators in an algorithm that iteratively proposes the most informative instruments at each round of experimentation to maximize the overall information about the full causal effect.",

To address this challenge, we formally discuss and reformulate MTSC as a weakly supervised problem, introducing a novel multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework for better localization of patterns of interest and modeling time dependencies within time series. Our novel approach, TimeMIL, formulates the temporal correlation and ordering within a time-aware MIL pooling, leveraging a tokenized transformer with a specialized learnable wavelet positional token.

    "abstract": "Event-based object detection has attracted increasing attention for its high temporal resolution, wide dynamic range, and asynchronous address-event representation. Leveraging these advantages, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, offering low energy consumption and rich spatiotemporal dynamics. To further enhance the performance of event-based object detection, this study proposes a novel hybrid spike vision Transformer (HsVT) model. The HsVT model integrates a spatial feature extraction module to capture local and global features, and a temporal feature extraction module to model time dependencies and long-term patterns in event sequences. This combination enables HsVT to capture spatiotemporal features, improving its capability in handling complex event-based object detection tasks. To support research in this area, we developed the Fall Detection dataset as a benchmark for event-based object detection tasks. The Fall DVS detection dataset protects facial privacy and reduces memory usage thanks to its event-based representation. Experimental results demonstrate that HsVT outperforms existing SNN methods and achieves competitive performance compared to ANN-based models, with fewer parameters and lower energy consumption.",

However, the best current models of lower-level auditory processing in the human brain rely on either hand-constructed acoustic filters or representations from supervised audio neural networks. In this work, we capitalize on the progress of self-supervised speech representation learning (SSL) to create new state-of-the-art models of the human auditory system. Compared against acoustic baselines, phonemic features, and supervised models, representations from the middle layers of self-supervised models (APC, wav2vec, wav2vec 2.0, and HuBERT) consistently yield the best prediction performance for fMRI recordings within the auditory cortex (AC). Brain areas involved in low-level auditory processing exhibit a preference for earlier SSL model layers, whereas higher-level semantic areas prefer later layers. We show that these trends are due to the models\u2019 ability to encode information at multiple linguistic levels (acoustic, phonetic, and lexical) along their representation depth. Overall, these results show that self-supervised models effectively capture the hierarchy of information relevant to different stages of speech processing in human cortex.",

Existing models generally assume access to the same data sources during both training and inference stages. However, this assumption is often challenged by the fact that real-world clinical datasets originate from various data sources (with distinct sets of covariates), which though can be available for training (in a research or retrospective setting), are more realistically only partially available (a subset of such sets) for inference when deployed. So motivated, we introduce Contrastive Learning for clinical Outcome Prediction with Partial data Sources (CLOPPS), that trains encoders to capture information across different data sources and then leverages them to build classifiers restricting access to a single data source. This approach can be used with existing cross-sectional or longitudinal outcome classification models. We present experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrating that CLOPPS consistently outperforms strong baselines in several practical scenarios.",

To tackle the scarcity of annotated mutation data, pre-training with massive unlabeled data has emerged as a promising solution. However, this process faces a series of challenges: (1) complex higher-order dependencies among multiple (more than paired) structural scales have not yet been fully captured; (2) it is rarely explored how mutations alter the local conformation of the surrounding microenvironment; (3) pre-training is costly, both in data size and computational burden. In this paper, we first construct a hierarchical prompt codebook to record common microenvironmental patterns at different structural scales independently. Then, we develop a novel codebook pre-training task, namely masked microenvironment modeling, to model the joint distribution of each mutation with their residue types, angular statistics, and local conformational changes in the microenvironment. With the constructed prompt codebook, we encode the microenvironment around each mutation into multiple hierarchical prompts and combine them to flexibly provide information to wild-type and mutated protein complexes about their microenvironmental differences. Such a hierarchical prompt learning framework has demonstrated superior performance and training efficiency over state-of-the-art pre-training-based methods in mutation effect prediction and a case study of optimizing human antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.",

In this paper, we propose an evidential interactive learning framework that leverages evidence-based uncertainty estimation and interactive machine learning to improve image captioning with limited labeled data. The interactive learning process involves three stages: keyword prediction, caption generation, and model retraining. First, the model predicts a list of keywords with evidence-based uncertainty and selects the most informative keywords to seek user feedback. Second, user-approved keywords are used as model input to guide the model to generate satisfactory captions. Third, the model is updated based on user-approved keywords and captions, where evidence-based uncertainty is used to allocate different weights to different data instances. Experiments on two medical image datasets illustrate that the proposed framework can effectively learn from human feedback and improve the model's performance in the future.",

Current machine learning approaches rely on expensive training procedures and under-utilize growing quantities of atomistic data, limiting scalability and generalization. Generative models of atomistic conformational ensembles sample temporally independent states from energy landscapes, but their application to TPS remains mostly unexplored. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of generative models, namely denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional, enabling us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot fashion. We demonstrate our approach on a M\u00fcller-Brown potential and several fast-folding proteins, where we obtain diverse, physically realistic transition pathways, as well as tetrapeptides, where we demonstrate successful TPS on systems not seen by the generative model during training. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve.",

We pose the initial learning stage as a weakly-supervised contrastive-learning problem, where each antibody sequence is associated with possibly multiple identifiers of function and the objective is to learn an encoder that groups them according to their patented properties. We then freeze a part of the contrastive encoder and continue training it on the patent data using the cross-entropy loss to predict the humanness score of a given antibody sequence. We illustrate the utility of the patent data and our approach by performing inference on three different immunogenicity datasets, unseen during training.

We propose a tree-based model averaging approach to improve the estimation accuracy of conditional average treatment effects (CATE) at a target site by leveraging models derived from other potentially heterogeneous sites, without them sharing subject-level data. To our best knowledge, there is no established model averaging approach for distributed data with a focus on improving the estimation of treatment effects. Specifically, under distributed data networks, our framework provides an interpretable tree-based ensemble of CATE estimators that joins models across study sites, while actively modeling the heterogeneity in data sources through site partitioning.

In this line of work, a diffusion model over rigid bodies in 3D (referred to as frames) has shown success in generating novel, functional protein backbones that have not been observed in nature. However, there exists no principled methodological framework for diffusion on SE(3), the space of orientation preserving rigid motions in R3, that operates on frames and confers the group invariance. We address these shortcomings by developing theoretical foundations of SE(3) invariant diffusion models on multiple frames followed by a novel framework, FrameDiff, for estimating the SE(3) equivariant score over multiple frames. We apply FrameDiff on monomer backbone generation and find it can generate designable monomers up to 500 amino acids without relying on a pretrained protein structure prediction network that has been integral to previous methods.

Thus, by definition the target sequences and their attribute values are out of the training distribution, posing challenges to existing methods that aim to directly generate the target sequence. Instead, in this work, we propose Iterative Controlled Extrapolation (ICE) which iteratively makes local edits to a sequence to enable extrapolation.

Recent work in the field of protein diffusion probabilistic modelling has leveraged Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) and, for the first time, introduced information about large scale protein motion into the generative process. However, obtaining molecules with both the desired dynamics and designable quality has proven challenging. In this work, we present NMA-tune, a new method that introduces the dynamics information to the protein design stage. NMA-tune uses a trainable component to condition the backbone generation on the lowest normal mode of oscillation. We implement NMA-tune as a plug-and-play extension to RFdiffusion, show that the proportion of samples with high quality structure and the desired dynamics is improved as compared to other methods without the trainable component, and we show the presence of the targeted modes in the Molecular Dynamics simulations.",

One common type of concept shift in medical image segmentation is the \"information imbalance\" between label-sparse samples with few (if any) segmentation labels and label-dense samples with plentiful labeled pixels. Existing distributionally robust algorithms have focused on adaptively truncating/down-weighting the \"less informative\" (i.e., label-sparse in our context) samples. To exploit data features of label-sparse samples more efficiently, we propose an adaptively weighted online optimization algorithm --- AdaWAC --- to incorporate data augmentation consistency regularization in sample reweighting. Our method introduces a set of trainable weights to balance the supervised loss and unsupervised consistency regularization of each sample separately. At the saddle point of the underlying objective, the weights assign label-dense samples to the supervised loss and label-sparse samples to the unsupervised consistency regularization. We provide a convergence guarantee by recasting the optimization as online mirror descent on a saddle point problem. Our empirical results demonstrate that AdaWAC not only enhances the segmentation performance and sample efficiency but also improves the robustness to concept shift on various medical image segmentation tasks with different UNet-style backbones.",

Prior work has primarily focused on strong adversarial assumptions, including attacker access to entire samples or long, ordered prefixes, leaving open the question of how vulnerable LLMs are when adversaries have only partial, unordered sample information. For example, if an attacker knows a patient has \"hypertension,\" under what conditions can they query a model fine-tuned on patient data to learn the patient also has \"osteoarthritis?\" In this paper, we introduce a more general threat model under this weaker assumption and show that fine-tuned LLMs are susceptible to these fragment-specific extraction attacks. To systematically investigate these attacks, we propose two data-blind methods: (1) a likelihood ratio attack inspired by methods from membership inference, and (2) a novel approach, PRISM, which regularizes the ratio by leveraging an external prior. Using examples from medical and legal settings, we show that both methods are competitive with a data-aware baseline classifier that assumes access to labeled in-distribution data, underscoring their robustness.",

In this paper, we propose GuardAgent, the first guardrail agent to protect target agents by dynamically checking whether their actions satisfy given safety guard requests. Specifically, GuardAgent first analyzes the safety guard requests to generate a task plan, and then maps this plan into guardrail code for execution. By performing the code execution, GuardAgent can deterministically follow the safety guard request and safeguard target agents. In both steps, an LLM is utilized as the reasoning component, supplemented by in-context demonstrations retrieved from a memory module storing experiences from previous tasks. In addition, we propose two novel benchmarks: EICU-AC benchmark to assess the access control for healthcare agents and Mind2Web-SC benchmark to evaluate the safety policies for web agents. We show that GuardAgent effectively moderates the violation actions for different types of agents on these two benchmarks with over 98% and 83%\nguardrail accuracies, respectively.

Additionally, they typically rely on information that is not generally or readily available, such as homologous sequences, related protein structures and other complementary information. To address these issues, we developed BIFROST, a novel take on the fragment library problem based on a Deep Markov Model architecture combined with directional statistics for angular degrees of freedom, implemented in the deep probabilistic programming language Pyro. BIFROST is a probabilistic, generative model of the protein backbone dihedral angles conditioned solely on the amino acid sequence.

In this paper, we propose ProtoGate, a prototype-based neural model for feature selection on HDLSS data. ProtoGate first selects instance-wise features via adaptively balancing global and local feature selection. Furthermore, ProtoGate employs a non-parametric prototype-based prediction mechanism to tackle the co-adaptation problem, ensuring the feature selection results and predictions are consistent with underlying data clusters. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance and interpretability of ProtoGate on synthetic and real-world datasets.

In this paper, we introduce the Med-ST framework for fine-grained spatial and temporal modeling to exploit information from multiple spatial views of chest radiographs and temporal historical records. For spatial modeling, Med-ST employs the *Mixture of View Expert (MoVE)* architecture to integrate different visual features from both frontal and lateral views. To achieve a more comprehensive alignment, Med-ST not only establishes the global alignment between whole images and texts but also introduces modality-weighted local alignment between text tokens and spatial regions of images. For temporal modeling, we propose a novel cross-modal bidirectional cycle consistency objective by forward mapping classification (FMC) and reverse mapping regression (RMR). By perceiving temporal information from simple to complex, Med-ST can learn temporal semantics. Experimental results across four distinct tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Med-ST, especially in temporal classification tasks.

To overcome this limitation, we propose the first globally consistent anisotropic kernels for GNNs, allowing for graph convolutions that are defined according to topologicaly-derived directional flows. First, by defining a vector field in the graph, we develop a method of applying directional derivatives and smoothing by projecting node-specific messages into the field. Then, we propose the use of the Laplacian eigenvectors as such vector field. We show that the method generalizes CNNs on an $n$-dimensional grid and is provably more discriminative than standard GNNs regarding the Weisfeiler-Lehman 1-WL test. We evaluate our method on different standard benchmarks and see a relative error reduction of 8% on the CIFAR10 graph dataset and 11% to 32% on the molecular ZINC dataset, and a relative increase in precision of 1.6% on the MolPCBA dataset.

Generative frameworks provide useful tools to learn continuous representations of molecules in a latent space. While modelers could optimize chemical properties, many generated molecules are not synthesizable. To design synthetically accessible molecules that preserve main structural motifs of target molecules, we propose a reaction-embedded and structure-conditioned variational autoencoder. As the latent space jointly encodes molecular structures and their reaction routes, our new sampling method that measures the path-informed structural similarity allows us to effectively generate structurally analogous synthesizable molecules. When targeting out-of-domain as well as in-domain seed structures, our model generates structurally and property-wisely similar molecules equipped with well-defined reaction paths. By focusing on the important region in chemical space, we also demonstrate that our model can design new molecules with even higher activity than the seed molecules.",

However, in high-dimensional treatment settings, existing methods face significant challenges due to data sparsity within treatment groups and highly unbalanced covariate distributions across groups. To address these challenges, we propose a novel calibration-weighted treatment fusion procedure that robustly balances covariates across treatment groups and fuses similar treatments using a penalized working model. The fusion procedure ensures the recovery of latent treatment group structures when either the calibration model or the outcome model is correctly specified. In the fused treatment space, practitioners can seamlessly apply state-of-the-art ITR learning methods with the flexibility to utilize a subset of covariates, thereby achieving robustness while addressing practical concerns such as fairness. We establish theoretical guarantees, including consistency, the oracle property of treatment fusion, and regret bounds when integrated with multi-armed ITR learning methods such as policy trees. Simulation studies show superior group recovery and policy value compared to existing approaches. We illustrate the practical utility of our method using EHR-derived data from patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma.",

Recognizing the importance of these interactions, we introduce APM (all-Atom Protein generative Model), a model specifically designed for modeling multi-chain proteins. By integrating atom-level information and leveraging data on multi-chain proteins, APM is capable of precisely modeling inter-chain interactions and designing protein complexes with binding capabilities from scratch. It also performs folding and inverse-folding tasks for multi-chain proteins. Moreover, APM demonstrates versatility in downstream applications: it achieves enhanced performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while also supporting zero-shot sampling in certain tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

In light of surface point clouds' sparsity and disorder properties, we first partition them into patches and obtain the sequential arrangement via the Morton curve. Successively, a Transformer-based architecture named SurfFormer was introduced to integrate the surface geometry and capture patch-level relations. At last, we enhance the prevalent masked auto-encoder (MAE) with the vector quantization (VQ) technique, which establishes a surface pattern codebook to enforce a discrete posterior distribution of latent variables and achieve more condensed semantics.

    "abstract": "Many processes in biology and drug discovery involve various 3D interactions between molecules, such as protein and protein, protein and small molecule, etc. Given that different molecules are usually represented in different granularity, existing methods usually encode each type of molecules independently with different models, leaving it defective to learn the various underlying interaction physics. In this paper, we first propose to universally represent an arbitrary 3D complex as a geometric graph of sets, shedding light on encoding all types of molecules with one model. We then propose a Generalist Equivariant Transformer (GET) to effectively capture both domain-specific hierarchies and domain-agnostic interaction physics. To be specific, GET consists of a bilevel attention module, a feed-forward module and a layer normalization module, where each module is E(3) equivariant and specialized for handling sets of variable sizes. Notably, in contrast to conventional pooling-based hierarchical models, our GET is able to retain fine-grained information of all levels. Extensive experiments on the interactions between proteins, small molecules and RNA/DNAs verify the effectiveness and generalization capability of our proposed method across different domains.",

Inspired by the recent huge success of Stable (latent) Diffusion models, we propose a novel and principled method for 3D molecule generation named Geometric Latent Diffusion Models (GeoLDM). GeoLDM is the first latent DM model for the molecular geometry domain, composed of autoencoders encoding structures into continuous latent codes and DMs operating in the latent space. Our key innovation is that for modeling the 3D molecular geometries, we capture its critical roto-translational equivariance constraints by building a point-structured latent space with both invariant scalars and equivariant tensors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoLDM can consistently achieve better performance on multiple molecule generation benchmarks, with up to 7% improvement for the valid percentage of large biomolecules. Results also demonstrate GeoLDM's higher capacity for controllable generation thanks to the latent modeling. Code is provided at https://github.com/MinkaiXu/GeoLDM.",

Targeted research on pediatric tumors is urgently needed but lacks sufficient attention. In this work, we propose a novel model to solve the diagnosis task of small round blue cell tumors (SRBCTs). To solve the problem of high noise and high diversity in the small sample scenario, the model is constrained to pay attention to the valid areas in the pathological image with a masking mechanism, and a length-aware loss is proposed to improve the tolerance to feature diversity. We evaluate this framework on a challenging small sample SRBCTs dataset, whose classification is difficult even for professional pathologists.

Deep generative models of protein sequences trained on multiple sequence alignments have been the most successful approaches so far to address these tasks. The performance of these methods is however contingent on the availability of sufficiently deep and diverse alignments for reliable training. Their potential scope is thus limited by the fact many protein families are hard, if not impossible, to align. Large language models trained on massive quantities of non-aligned protein sequences from diverse families address these problems and show potential to eventually bridge the performance gap. We introduce Tranception, a novel transformer architecture leveraging autoregressive predictions and retrieval of homologous sequences at inference to achieve state-of-the-art fitness prediction performance. Given its markedly higher performance on multiple mutants, robustness to shallow alignments and ability to score indels, our approach offers significant gain of scope over existing approaches.

In particular, we aim to explain the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action on the outcome of a realized scenario through its influence on the environment dynamics and the agents' behavior. To achieve this, we introduce a novel causal explanation formula that decomposes the counterfactual effect by attributing to each agent and state variable a score reflecting their respective contributions to the effect. First, we show that the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action can be decomposed into two components: one measuring the effect that propagates through all subsequent agents' actions and another related to the effect that propagates through the state transitions. Building on recent advancements in causal contribution analysis, we further decompose these two effects as follows. For the former, we consider agent-specific effects -- a causal concept that quantifies the counterfactual effect of an agent's action that propagates through a subset of agents. Based on this notion, we use Shapley value to attribute the effect to individual agents. For the latter, we consider the concept of structure-preserving interventions and attribute the effect to state variables based on their \"intrinsic'' contributions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the interpretability of our approach in a Gridworld environment with LLM-assisted agents and a sepsis management simulator.",

Most existing approaches are usually divided into two steps by first predicting the distances between atoms and then generating a 3D structure through optimizing a distance geometry problem. However, the distances predicted with such two-stage approaches may not be able to consistently preserve the geometry of local atomic neighborhoods, making the generated structures unsatisfying. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end solution for molecular conformation prediction called ConfVAE based on the conditional variational autoencoder framework. Specifically, the molecular graph is first encoded in a latent space, and then the 3D structures are generated by solving a principled bilevel optimization program.

We study a clinically-inspired selective label problem called disparate censorship, where labeling biases vary across subgroups and unlabeled individuals are imputed as \u201cnegative\u201d (i.e., no diagnostic test = no illness). Machine learning models naively trained on such labels could amplify labeling bias. Inspired by causal models of selective labels, we propose Disparate Censorship Expectation-Maximization (DCEM), an algorithm for learning in the presence of disparate censorship. We theoretically analyze how DCEM mitigates the effects of disparate censorship on model performance. We validate DCEM on synthetic data, showing that it improves bias mitigation (area between ROC curves) without sacrificing discriminative performance (AUC) compared to baselines. We achieve similar results in a sepsis classification task using clinical data.",

These acquisition functions allow LaMBO to balance the explore-exploit tradeoff over multiple design rounds, and to balance objective tradeoffs by optimizing sequences at many different points on the Pareto frontier. We evaluate LaMBO on two small-molecule design tasks, and introduce new tasks optimizing in silico and in vitro properties of large-molecule fluorescent proteins.

Nevertheless, when applying policy gradients to SDEs, since the policy gradient is estimated on a finite set of trajectories, it can be ill-defined, and the policy behavior in data-scarce regions may be uncontrolled. This challenge compromises the stability of policy gradients and negatively impacts sample complexity. To address these issues, we propose constraining the SDE to be consistent with its associated perturbation process. Since the perturbation process covers the entire space and is easy to sample, we can mitigate the aforementioned problems. Our framework offers a general approach allowing for a versatile selection of policy gradient methods to effectively and efficiently train SDEs.

    "abstract": "We introduce *GraphGPT*, a novel self-supervised *generative pre-trained* model for graph learning based on the *Graph Eulerian Transformer* (**GET**). First, we propose **GET**, which combines a standard transformer encoder or decoder architecture with an innovative graph-to-sequence transformation method. This method converts graphs or sampled subgraphs into sequences of tokens representing nodes, edges, and attributes in a reversible manner using Eulerian paths. We pre-train **GET** using either of the two self-supervised tasks: next-token prediction (NTP) and scheduled masked-token prediction (SMTP). The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as graph-, edge-, and node-level prediction. Despite its simplicity, GraphGPT achieves performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on multiple large-scale Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets. It demonstrates exceptional results on the molecular property prediction dataset PCQM4Mv2 and the protein-protein interaction dataset ogbl-ppa. Notably, generative pre-training enables scaling GraphGPT to 2 billion parameters while maintaining performance gains \u2014 a breakthrough that overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and prior graph transformers (GTs).

They however fall short in their ability to quantify confidence in their predictions \u2014 this is crucial in high-stakes applications that involve critical decision-making. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) aim at solving this problem by placing a prior distribution over the network\u2019s parameters, thereby inducing a posterior distribution that encapsulates predictive uncertainty. While existing variants of BNNs based on Monte Carlo dropout produce reliable (albeit approximate) uncertainty estimates over in-distribution data, they tend to exhibit over-confidence in predictions made on target data whose feature distribution differs from the training data, i.e., the covariate shift setup. In this paper, we develop an approximate Bayesian inference scheme based on posterior regularisation, wherein unlabelled target data are used as \u201cpseudo-labels\u201d of model confidence that are used to regularise the model\u2019s loss on labelled source data.

    "abstract": "Cell identity encompasses various semantic aspects of a cell, including cell type, pathway information, disease information, and more, which are essential for biologists to gain insights into its biological characteristics. Understanding cell identity from the transcriptomic data, such as annotating cell types, has become an important task in bioinformatics. As these semantic aspects are determined by human experts, it is impossible for AI models to effectively carry out cell identity understanding tasks without the supervision signals provided by single-cell and label pairs. The single-cell pre-trained language models (PLMs) currently used for this task are trained only on a single modality, transcriptomics data, lack an understanding of cell identity knowledge. As a result, they have to be fine-tuned for downstream tasks and struggle when lacking labeled data with the desired semantic labels. To address this issue, we propose an innovative solution by constructing a unified representation of single-cell data and natural language during the pre-training phase, allowing the model to directly incorporate insights related to cell identity. More specifically, we introduce **LangCell**, the first **Lang**uage-**Cell** pre-training framework. LangCell utilizes texts enriched with cell identity information to gain a profound comprehension of cross-modal knowledge. Results from experiments conducted on different benchmarks show that LangCell is the only single-cell PLM that can work effectively in zero-shot cell identity understanding scenarios, and also significantly outperforms existing models in few-shot and fine-tuning cell identity understanding scenarios.",

PPDiff builds upon our developed Sequence Structure Interleaving Network with Causal attention layers (SSINC), which integrates interleaved self-attention layers to capture global amino acid correlations, $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$NN) equivariant graph convolutional layers to model local interactions in three-dimensional (3D) space, and causal attention layers to simplify the intricate interdependencies within the protein sequence. To assess PPDiff, we curate PPBench, a general protein-protein complex dataset comprising 706,360 complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The model is pretrained on PPBench and finetuned on two real-world applications: target-protein mini-binder complex design and antigen-antibody complex design.

Analyzing such sparse high-dimensional compositional data naturally calls for dimension reduction or, more preferably, variable selection. Most existing approaches lack interpretability or cannot handle zeros properly, as they rely on a log-ratio transformation. We approach this problem with sufficient dimension reduction (SDR), one of the most studied dimension reduction frameworks in statistics. Characterized by the conditional independence of the data to the response on the found subspace, the SDR framework has been effective for both linear and nonlinear dimension reduction problems. This work proposes a compositional SDR that can handle zeros naturally while incorporating the nonlinear nature and spurious negative correlations among components rigorously. A critical consideration of sub-composition versus amalgamation for compositional variable selection is discussed. The proposed compositional SDR is shown to be statistically consistent in constructing a sub-simplex consisting of true signal variables. Simulation and real microbiome data are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed SDR compared to existing state-of-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the neural implementation of complex human behaviors is one of the major goals in neuroscience. To this end, it is crucial to find a true representation of the neural data, which is challenging due to the high complexity of behaviors and the low signal-to-ratio (SNR) of the signals. Here, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework, Neural Latent Aligner (NLA), to find well-constrained, behaviorally relevant neural representations of complex behaviors. The key idea is to align representations across repeated trials to learn cross-trial consistent information. Furthermore, we propose a novel, fully differentiable time warping model (TWM) to resolve the temporal misalignment of trials. When applied to intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) of natural speaking, our model learns better representations for decoding behaviors than the baseline models, especially in lower dimensional space. The TWM is empirically validated by measuring behavioral coherence between aligned trials. The proposed framework learns more cross-trial consistent representations than the baselines, and when visualized, the manifold reveals shared neural trajectories across trials.",

We present *Generalist Molecular generative model* (GenMol), a versatile framework that uses only a *single* discrete diffusion model to handle diverse drug discovery scenarios. GenMol generates Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing the utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering while having better sampling efficiency. GenMol uses fragments as basic building blocks for molecules and introduces *fragment remasking*, a strategy that optimizes molecules by regenerating masked fragments, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. We further propose *molecular context guidance* (MCG), a guidance method tailored for masked discrete diffusion of GenMol. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model in *de novo* generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization.

While most work focuses on improving reconstruction quality, generalization accuracy and robustness are equally important, especially for safety-critical applications. Model-based architectures (MBAs), such as loop unrolling methods, are considered more interpretable and achieve better reconstructions. Empirical evidence suggests that MBAs are more robust to perturbations than black-box solvers, but the accuracy-robustness tradeoff in MBAs remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training scheme for MBAs, called SGD jittering, which injects noise iteration-wise during reconstruction. We theoretically demonstrate that SGD jittering not only generalizes better than the standard mean squared error training but is also more robust to average-case attacks. We validate SGD jittering using denoising toy examples, seismic deconvolution, and single-coil MRI reconstruction. Both SGD jittering and its SPGD extension yield cleaner reconstructions for out-of-distribution data and demonstrates enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks.",

Our approach accounts for a data generating process where the ground-truth is a mixture of distributions conditional on a continuous latent variable, as seen in collaborative filtering, using the variational autoencoder framework. Empirical data simulation demonstrates that our method outperforms other likelihood functions used to model count data, both in terms of accuracy of population size estimate and learning an informative latent space.

    "abstract": "Deciphering protein folding and unfolding pathways under tension is essential for deepening our understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms. Such insights hold the promise of developing treatments for a range of debilitating and fatal conditions, including muscular disorders like Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) is a powerful technique for investigating forces involved in protein domains folding and unfolding. However, SMFS trials often involve multiple protein molecules, necessitating filtering to isolate measurements from single-molecule trials. Currently, manual visual inspection is the primary method for classifying single-molecule data; a process that is both time-consuming and requires significant expertise. Here, we both apply state-of-the-art machine learning models and present a novel deep learning model tailored to SMFS data. The proposed model employs a dual-branch fusion strategy; one branch integrates the physics of protein molecules, and the other operates independently of physical constraints. This model automates the isolation of single-molecule measurements, significantly enhancing data processing efficiency. To train and validate our approach, we developed a physics-based Monte Carlo engine to simulate force spectroscopy datasets, including trials involving single molecules, multiple molecules, and no molecules. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming five baseline methods on both simulated and experimental datasets. It attains nearly 100\\% accuracy across all simulated datasets and an average accuracy of $79.6 \\pm 5.2$\\% on experimental datasets, using only $\\sim$30 training samples, surpassing baseline methods by 11.4\\%. Notably, even without expert annotations on experimental data, the model achieves an average accuracy of $72.0 \\pm 5.9$\\% when pre-trained on corresponding simulated datasets. With our deep learning approach, the time required to extract meaningful statistics from single-molecule SMFS trials is reduced from a day to under an hour. This work results in SMFS experimental datasets from four important protein molecules crucial to many biological pathways. To support further research, we have made our datasets publicly available and provided a Python-based toolbox (https://github.com/SalapakaLab-SIMBioSys/SMFS-Identification).",

Recent advances in generative modeling, particularly denoising diffusion models, have enabled efficient accurate protein structure prediction and conformation sampling by learning distributions over crystallographic structures. However, effectively integrating physical supervision into these data-driven approaches remains challenging, as standard energy-based objectives often lead to intractable optimization.

The coordination of actuators, known as muscle synergies in neuromechanics, is considered a presumptive mechanism that simplifies the generation of motor commands. The dynamical structure of a system is the basis of its function, allowing us to derive a synergistic representation of actuators. Motivated by this theory, we propose the *Dynamical Synergistic Representation (DynSyn)* algorithm.

Compared with single-stage generation, the easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second stage generation toward a high-quality molecule in a goal-oriented way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 50\\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations. Furthermore, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly reducing the generation iterations needed.",

However, due to individual variation, such as anatomy, and differences in task design and scanning hardware, leveraging data across subjects and datasets remains challenging. In turn, the field has not benefited from the growing number of open neural data repositories to exploit large-scale deep learning. To address this, we develop neuroscience-informed self-supervised objectives, together with an architecture, for learning from heterogeneous brain recordings. Scaling to nearly **400 hours** of MEG data and **900 subjects**, our approach shows generalisation across participants, datasets, tasks, and even to *novel* subjects. It achieves **improvements of 15-27%** over state-of-the-art models and **matches *surgical* decoding performance with *non-invasive* data**.

Quantum computing is known a promising direction for its potential theoretical supremacy for large-scale graph and combinatorial problem as well as the increasing evidence for the availability to physical quantum devices in the near term. In this paper, for the first time to our best knowledge, we propose a quantum 3D embedding ansatz that learns the latent representation of 3D structures from the Hilbert space composed of the Bloch sphere of each qubit. Specifically, the 3D Cartesian coordinates of nodes are converted into rotation and torsion angles and then encode them into the form of qubits. Moreover, Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) is applied to serve as the trainable layers and the output of the PQC is adopted as the final node embedding. Experimental results on two downstream tasks, molecular property prediction and 3D molecular geometries generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. We show the capacity and capability of our model with the evaluation on the QM9 dataset (134k molecules) with very few parameters, and its potential to be executed on a real quantum device.",

We present a general pipeline, dubbed as FavMac, to maximize the value while controlling the cost in such scenarios. FavMac can be combined with almost any multi-label classifier, affording distribution-free theoretical guarantees on cost control. Moreover, unlike prior works, FavMac can handle real-world large-scale applications via a carefully designed online update mechanism, which is of independent interest.

To tackle this problem using machine learning methods, here we propose a novel and effective framework, known as GraphBP, to generate 3D molecules that bind to given proteins by placing atoms of specific types and locations to the given binding site one by one. In particular, at each step, we first employ a 3D graph neural network to obtain geometry-aware and chemically informative representations from the intermediate contextual information. Such context includes the given binding site and atoms placed in the previous steps. Second, to preserve the desirable equivariance property, we select a local reference atom according to the designed auxiliary classifiers and then construct a local spherical coordinate system. Finally, to place a new atom, we generate its atom type and relative location w.r.t. the constructed local coordinate system via a flow model. We also consider generating the variables of interest sequentially to capture the underlying dependencies among them. Experiments demonstrate that our GraphBP is effective to generate 3D molecules with binding ability to target protein binding sites.

These models are commonly trained in two stages: first, a data compressor is trained, and in a subsequent training stage a flow matching generative model is trained in the latent space of the data compressor. This two-stage paradigm sets obstacles for unifying models across data domains, as hand-crafted compressors architectures are used for different data modalities. To this end, we introduce INRFlow, a domain-agnostic approach to learn flow matching transformers directly in ambient space. Drawing inspiration from INRs, we introduce a conditionally independent point-wise training objective that enables INRFlow to make predictions continuously in coordinate space. Our empirical results demonstrate that INRFlow effectively handles different data modalities such as images, 3D point clouds and protein structure data, achieving strong performance in different domains and outperforming comparable approaches. INRFlow is a promising step towards domain-agnostic flow matching generative models that can be trivially adopted in different data domains.",

Most of them first generate atoms and then add chemical bonds based on the generated atoms in a post-processing manner. However, there might be no corresponding bond solution for the temporally generated atoms as their locations are generated without considering potential bonds. We define this problem as the atom-bond inconsistency problem and claim it is the main reason for current approaches to generating unrealistic 3D molecules. To overcome this problem, we propose a new diffusion model called MolDiff which can generate atoms and bonds simultaneously while still maintaining their consistency by explicitly modeling the dependence between their relationships. We evaluated the generation ability of our proposed model and the quality of the generated molecules using criteria related to both geometry and chemical properties. The empirical studies showed that our model outperforms previous approaches, achieving a three-fold improvement in success rate and generating molecules with significantly better quality.",

With spike trains only recorded from visible neurons, existing works use variational inference to learn POGLM meanwhile presenting the difficulty of learning this latent variable model. There are two main issues: (1) the sampled Poisson hidden spike count hinders the use of the pathwise gradient estimator in VI; and (2) the existing design of the variational model is neither expressive nor time-efficient, which further affects the performance. For (1), we propose a new differentiable POGLM, which enables the pathwise gradient estimator, better than the score function gradient estimator used in existing works. For (2), we propose the forward-backward message-passing sampling scheme for the variational model. Comprehensive experiments show that our differentiable POGLMs with our forward-backward message passing produce a better performance on one synthetic and two real-world datasets.

However, it is challenging to compare predictive performance against an existing decision-making policy that is generally under-specified and dependent on unobservable factors. These sources of uncertainty are often addressed in practice by making strong assumptions about the data-generating mechanism. In this work, we propose a method to compare the predictive performance of decision policies under a variety of modern identification approaches from the causal inference and off-policy evaluation literatures (e.g., instrumental variable, marginal sensitivity model, proximal variable). Key to our method is the insight that there are regions of uncertainty that we can safely ignore in the policy comparison. We develop a practical approach for finite-sample estimation of regret intervals under no assumptions on the parametric form of the status quo policy. We verify our framework theoretically and via synthetic data experiments. We conclude with a real-world application using our framework to support a pre-deployment evaluation of a proposed modification to a healthcare enrollment policy.",

We replace the vanilla attention layer with an outlier-free mechanism inspired by associative memory models. By removing outliers during both pre-training and fine-tuning, this approach accelerates adaptation, reduces computational costs, and enhances quantization robustness within acceptable loss margins. Additionally, we propose GERM-T, a strategy that employs small-step continual learning within the outlier-free framework, leveraging original checkpoints to avoid retraining from scratch. Empirically, GERM improves fine-tuning performance by 37.98% and quantization by 64.34% over the baseline model. It also reduces average kurtosis by 92.14% and maximum infinity norm by 82.77%. Compared to leading methods, GERM consistently delivers superior performance, offering a practical solution for genomic modeling in resource-constrained settings.",

We evaluate performance objectives that have operational meanings in practical clinical trials, including cumulative efficacy, recommendation/allocation success probabilities, toxicity violation probability, and sample efficiency.

Among all TPP models, Hawkes processes have proven to be the most widely used, mainly due to their adequate modeling for various applications, particularly when considering exponential or non-parametric kernels. Although non-parametric kernels are an option, such models require large datasets. While exponential kernels are more data efficient and relevant for specific applications where events immediately trigger more events, they are ill-suited for applications where latencies need to be estimated, such as in neuroscience. This work aims to offer an efficient solution to TPP inference using general parametric kernels with finite support. The developed solution consists of a fast $\\ell_2$ gradient-based solver leveraging a discretized version of the events. After theoretically supporting the use of discretization, the statistical and computational efficiency of the novel approach is demonstrated through various numerical experiments. Finally, the method's effectiveness is evaluated by modeling the occurrence of stimuli-induced patterns from brain signals recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG).

These diffusion samplers are trained by reinforcement learning algorithms to enforce that the transformed samples $f_\\theta(\\mathbf{z})$ are distributed according to the posterior in the data space ($\\mathbf{x}$). \nFor many models and constraints, the posterior in noise space is smoother than in data space, making it more suitable for amortized inference. Our method enables conditional sampling under unconditional GAN, (H)VAE, and flow-based priors, comparing favorably with other inference methods. We demonstrate the proposed ___outsourced diffusion sampling___ in several experiments with large pretrained prior models: conditional image generation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and protein structure generation.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models provides an effective solution to alleviate the label scarcity problem in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) detection using electrocardiogram (ECG). However,  as the pre-trained models scale up, the computational costs for fine-tuning and inference become unaffordable on low-level devices deployed for clinical applications. Additionally, maintaining the model performance under low budgets in computational resources remains a significant challenge. However, a comprehensive study that can address them in a joint framework is still lacking. Here, we propose a holistic method (H-Tuning) for low-cost and efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained models on downstream datasets. Then, the inference costs of the models fine-tuned by H-Tuning are further reduced significantly using a knowledge distillation technique. Experiments on four ECG datasets demonstrate that H-Tuning reduces the GPU memory consumption during fine-tuning by 6.34 times while achieving comparable CVDs detection performance to standard fine-tuning. With the knowledge distillation technique, the model inference latency and the memory consumption are reduced by 4.52 times and 19.83 times. As such, the proposed joint framework allows for the utilization of pre-trained models with high computation efficiency and robust performance, exploring a path toward low-cost and efficient CVDs detection.

Many novel drugs also do not obey parametric modelling assumptions made in common dose-finding procedures. We present Safe Allocation for Exploration of Treatments SAFE-T, a procedure for adaptive dose-finding that adheres to safety constraints, improves utility for heterogeneous participants, and works well with small sample sizes. SAFE-T flexibly learns non-parametric multi-output Gaussian process models for dose toxicity and efficacy, using Bayesian optimization, and provides accurate final dose recommendations. We provide theoretical guarantees for the satisfaction of safety constraints. Using a comprehensive set of realistic synthetic scenarios, we demonstrate empirically that SAFE-T generally outperforms comparable methods and maintains performance across variations in sample size and subgroup distribution.

When applied to solving inverse problems, the reverse sampling steps are modified to approximately sample from a measurement-conditioned distribution. However, these modifications may be unsuitable for certain settings (e.g., presence of measurement noise) and non-linear tasks, as they often struggle to correct errors from earlier steps and generally require a large number of optimization and/or sampling steps. To address these challenges, we state three conditions for achieving measurement-consistent diffusion trajectories. Building on these conditions, we propose a new optimization-based sampling method that not only enforces standard data manifold measurement consistency and forward diffusion consistency, as seen in previous studies, but also incorporates our proposed step-wise and network-regularized backward diffusion consistency that maintains a diffusion trajectory by optimizing over the input of the pre-trained model at every sampling step. By enforcing these conditions (implicitly or explicitly), our sampler requires significantly fewer reverse steps. Therefore, we refer to our method as **S**tep-w**i**se **T**riple-**Co**nsistent Sa**m**pling (**SITCOM**). Compared to SOTA baselines, our experiments across several linear and non-linear tasks (with natural and medical images) demonstrate that SITCOM achieves competitive or superior results in terms of standard similarity metrics and run-time.",

To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework termed Trusted Multi-view Classification Constrained with Expert Knowledge (TMCEK). TMCEK integrates expert knowledge to enhance feature-level interpretability and introduces a distribution-aware subjective opinion mechanism to derive more reliable and realistic confidence estimates. The theoretical superiority of the proposed uncertainty measure over conventional approaches is rigorously established. Extensive experiments conducted on three multi-view datasets for sleep stage classification demonstrate that TMCEK achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering interpretability at both the feature and decision levels.

We revisit the classic idea of first predicting concepts that are provided at training time, and then using these concepts to predict the label. By construction, we can intervene on these concept bottleneck models by editing their predicted concept values and propagating these changes to the final prediction. On x-ray grading and bird identification, concept bottleneck models achieve competitive accuracy with standard end-to-end models, while enabling interpretation in terms of high-level clinical concepts (\"bone spurs\") or bird attributes (\"wing color\").

Raptor leverages a frozen 2D foundation model, pretrained on natural images, to extract visual tokens from individual cross-sections of medical volumes. These tokens are then spatially compressed using random projections, significantly reducing computational complexity while retaining rich semantic information. Extensive experiments on 10 diverse medical volume tasks verify the superior performance of Raptor over state-of-the-art methods, including those pretrained exclusively on medical volumes (+3 SuPreM, +6 MISFM, +10 Merlin, +13 VoCo, and +14 SLIViT), while entirely bypassing the need for costly training. Our results highlight Raptor's effectiveness and versatility as a foundation for advancing deep learning-based methods for medical volumes (code: github.com/sriramlab/raptor).",
