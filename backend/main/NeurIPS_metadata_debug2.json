    "abstract": "Mutual information (MI) is a general measure of statistical dependence with widespread application across the sciences. However, estimating MI between multi-dimensional variables is challenging because the number of samples necessary to converge to an accurate estimate scales unfavorably with dimensionality. In practice, existing techniques can reliably estimate MI in up to tens of dimensions, but fail in higher dimensions, where sufficient sample sizes are infeasible. Here, we explore the idea that underlying low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional data can be exploited to faithfully approximate MI in high-dimensional settings with realistic sample sizes. We develop a method that we call latent MI (LMI) approximation, which applies a nonparametric MI estimator to low-dimensional representations learned by a simple, theoretically-motivated model architecture. Using several benchmarks, we show that unlike existing techniques, LMI can approximate MI well for variables with $> 10^3$ dimensions if their dependence structure is captured by low-dimensional representations. Finally, we showcase LMI on two open problems in biology. First, we approximate MI between protein language model (pLM) representations of interacting proteins, and find that pLMs encode non-trivial information about protein-protein interactions. Second, we quantify cell fate information contained in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) measurements of hematopoietic stem cells, and find a sharp transition during neutrophil differentiation when fate information captured by scRNA-seq increases dramatically. An implementation of LMI is available at *latentmi.readthedocs.io.*",

    "abstract": "In Reinforcement Learning, agents learn policies by exploring and interacting with the environment. Due to the curse of dimensionality, learning policies that map high-dimensional sensory input to motor output is particularly challenging. During training, state of the art methods (SAC, PPO, etc.) explore the environment by perturbing the actuation with independent Gaussian noise. While this unstructured exploration has proven successful in numerous tasks, it can be suboptimal for overactuated systems. When multiple actuators, such as motors or muscles, drive behavior, uncorrelated perturbations risk diminishing each other's effect, or modifying the behavior in a task-irrelevant way. While solutions to introduce time correlation across action perturbations exist, introducing correlation across actuators has been largely ignored. Here, we propose LATent TIme-Correlated Exploration (Lattice), a method to inject temporally-correlated noise into the latent state of the policy network, which can be seamlessly integrated with on- and off-policy algorithms. We demonstrate that the noisy actions generated by perturbing the network's activations can be modeled as a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a full covariance matrix. In the PyBullet locomotion tasks, Lattice-SAC achieves state of the art results, and reaches 18\\% higher reward than unstructured exploration in the Humanoid environment. In the musculoskeletal control environments of MyoSuite, Lattice-PPO achieves higher reward in most reaching and object manipulation tasks, while also finding more energy-efficient policies with reductions of 20-60\\%. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of structured action noise in time and actuator space for complex motor control tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/amathislab/lattice.",

To combine the strengths of both approaches, we adopt a hybrid method that fine-tunes cutting-edge diffusion models by optimizing reward models through RL. Although prior work has explored similar avenues, they primarily focus on scenarios where accurate reward models are accessible. In contrast, we concentrate on an offline setting where a reward model is unknown, and we must learn from static offline datasets, a common scenario in scientific domains. In offline scenarios, existing approaches tend to suffer from overoptimization, as they may be misled by the reward model in out-of-distribution regions. To address this, we introduce a conservative fine-tuning approach, BRAID, by optimizing a conservative reward model, which includes additional penalization outside of offline data distributions. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to outperform the best designs in offline data, leveraging the extrapolation capabilities of reward models while avoiding the generation of invalid designs through pre-trained diffusion models.",

Existing methods in causal inference for continuous treatments using neural networks are effective and to some extent reduce selection bias, which is introduced by non-randomized treatments among individuals and might lead to covariate imbalance and thus unreliable inference. To theoretically support the alleviation of selection bias in the setting of continuous treatments, we exploit the re-weighting schema and the Integral Probability Metric (IPM) distance to derive an upper bound on the counterfactual loss of estimating the average dose-response function (ADRF), and herein the IPM distance builds a bridge from a source (factual) domain to an infinite number of target (counterfactual) domains. We provide a discretized approximation of the IPM distance with a theoretical guarantee in the practical implementation. Based on the theoretical analyses, we also propose a novel algorithm, called Average Dose- response estiMatIon via re-weighTing schema (ADMIT). ADMIT simultaneously learns a re-weighting network, which aims to alleviate the selection bias, and an inference network, which makes factual and counterfactual estimations. In addition, the effectiveness of ADMIT is empirically demonstrated in both synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments by outperforming the existing benchmarks.",

We introduce question-answering embeddings (QA-Emb), embeddings where each feature represents an answer to a yes/no question asked to an LLM. Training QA-Emb reduces to selecting a set of underlying questions rather than learning model weights.We use QA-Emb to flexibly generate interpretable models for predicting fMRI voxel responses to language stimuli. QA-Emb significantly outperforms an established interpretable baseline, and does so while requiring very few questions. This paves the way towards building flexible feature spaces that can concretize and evaluate our understanding of semantic brain representations. We additionally find that QA-Emb can be effectively approximated with an efficient model, and we explore broader applications in simple NLP tasks.",

Evaluating counterfactual image generation is substantially complex: not only it lacks observable ground truths, but also requires adherence to causal constraints. Although several counterfactual image generation methods and evaluation metrics exist a comprehensive comparison within a unified setting is lacking. We present a comparison framework to thoroughly benchmark counterfactual image generation methods.

Various dedicated algorithms have been recently proposed and studied by the machine-learning community. In contrast, active bipartite ranking rule is poorly documented in the literature. Due to its global nature, a strategy for labeling sequentially data points that are difficult to rank w.r.t. to the others is required. This learning task is much more complex than binary classification, for which many active algorithms have been designed. It is the goal of this article to provide a rigorous formulation of such a selective sampling approach. We propose a dedicated algorithm, referred to as active-rank, which aims to minimise the distance between the ROC curve of the ranking function built and the optimal one, w.r.t. the sup norm. We show that, for a fixed confidence level $\\epsilon$ and probability $\\delta$,  active-rank is PAC$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$. In addition, we provide a problem dependent upper bound on the expected sampling time of  active-rank and also demonstrate a problem dependent lower bound on the expected sampling time of any PAC$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$ algorithm. Beyond the theoretical analysis carried out, numerical results are presented, providing strong empirical evidence of the performance of the algorithm proposed, which compares favorably with more naive approaches.",

    "abstract": "Predicting high-fidelity 3D structures of atomic systems is a fundamental yet challenging problem in scientific domains. While recent work demonstrates the advantage of generative models in this realm, the exploration of different probability paths are still insufficient, and hallucinations during sampling are persistently occurring. To address these pitfalls, we introduce FlowDPO, a novel framework that explores various probability paths with flow matching models and further suppresses hallucinations using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for structure generation. Our approach begins with a pre-trained flow matching model to generate multiple candidate structures for each training sample. These structures are then evaluated and ranked based on their distance to the ground truth, resulting in an automatic preference dataset. Using this dataset, we apply DPO to optimize the original model, improving its performance in generating structures closely aligned with the desired reference distribution. As confirmed by our theoretical analysis, such paradigm and objective function are compatible with arbitrary Gaussian paths, exhibiting favorable universality. Extensive experimental results on antibodies and crystals demonstrate substantial benefits of our FlowDPO, highlighting its potential to advance the field of 3D structure prediction with generative models.",

We also relate VFM to score-based models, in which the dynamics are stochastic rather than deterministic, and derive a bound on the model likelihood based on a reweighted VFM objective.

Most recent PU learning methods are developed based on the misclassiﬁcation risk of the supervised learning type, and they may suffer from inaccurate estimates of class prior probabilities. In this paper, we introduce a variational principle for PU learning that allows us to quantitatively evaluate the modeling error of the Bayesian classiﬁer directly from given data. This leads to a loss function which can be efﬁciently calculated without involving class prior estimation or any other intermediate estimation problems, and the variational learning method can then be employed to optimize the classiﬁer under general conditions.

Existing meta-learning algorithms randomly sample meta-training tasks with a uniform probability, under the assumption that tasks are of equal importance. However, it is likely that tasks are detrimental with noise or imbalanced given a limited number of meta-training tasks. To prevent the meta-model from being corrupted by such detrimental tasks or dominated by tasks in the majority, in this paper, we propose an adaptive task scheduler (ATS) for the meta-training process. In ATS, for the first time, we design a neural scheduler to decide which meta-training tasks to use next by predicting the probability being sampled for each candidate task, and train the scheduler to optimize the generalization capacity of the meta-model to unseen tasks. We identify two meta-model-related factors as the input of the neural scheduler, which characterize the difficulty of a candidate task to the meta-model. Theoretically, we show that a scheduler taking the two factors into account improves the meta-training loss and also the optimization landscape. Under the setting of meta-learning with noise and limited budgets, ATS improves the performance on both miniImageNet and a real-world drug discovery benchmark by up to 13% and 18%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art task schedulers.",

However, during the multimodal training process, the model tends to rely on only one modality based on which it could learn faster, thus leading to inadequate use of other modalities. Existing methods to balance the training process always have some limitations on the loss functions, optimizers and the number of modalities and only consider modulating the magnitude of the gradients while ignoring the directions of the gradients. To solve these problems, in this paper, we present a novel method to balance multimodal learning with Classifier-Guided Gradient Modulation (CGGM), considering both the magnitude and directions of the gradients. We conduct extensive experiments on four multimodal datasets: UPMC-Food 101, CMU-MOSI, IEMOCAP and BraTS 2021, covering classification, regression and segmentation tasks.

Although TS enjoys strong theoretical guarantees and convincing empirical performance, it incurs a large computational overhead that scales polynomially with the optimization budget. Recently, scalable TS methods based on sparse GP models have been proposed to increase the scope of TS, enabling its application to problems that are sufficiently multi-modal, noisy or combinatorial to require more than a few hundred evaluations to be solved. However, the approximation error introduced by sparse GPs invalidates all existing regret bounds. In this work, we perform a theoretical and empirical analysis of scalable TS. We provide theoretical guarantees and show that the drastic reduction in computational complexity of scalable TS can be enjoyed without loss in the regret performance over the standard TS. These conceptual claims are validated for practical implementations of scalable TS on synthetic benchmarks and as part of a real-world high-throughput molecular design task.",

Inferring these multimodal functions from experimental data is a central task in modern protein engineering. Global epistasis models are an effective and physically-grounded class of models for estimating fitness functions from observed data. These models assume that a sparse latent function is transformed by a monotonic nonlinearity to emit measurable fitness. Here we demonstrate that minimizing supervised contrastive loss functions, such as the Bradley-Terry loss, is a simple and flexible technique for extracting the sparse latent function implied by global epistasis. We argue by way of a fitness-epistasis uncertainty principle that the nonlinearities in global epistasis models can produce observed fitness functions that do not admit sparse representations, and thus may be inefficient to learn from observations when using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss (a common practice). We show that contrastive losses are able to accurately estimate a ranking function from limited data even in regimes where MSE is ineffective and validate the practical utility of this insight by demonstrating that contrastive loss functions result in consistently improved performance on empirical benchmark tasks.",

We introduce a new challenge: molecular structure elucidation, which involves deducing a molecule’s structure from various types of spectral data. Solving such a molecular puzzle, akin to solving crossword puzzles, poses reasoning challenges that require integrating clues from diverse sources and engaging in iterative hypothesis testing. To address this challenging problem with LLMs, we present \\textbf{MolPuzzle}, a benchmark comprising 217 instances of structure elucidation, which feature over 23,000 QA samples presented in a sequential puzzle-solving process, involving three interlinked sub-tasks: molecule understanding, spectrum interpretation, and molecule construction. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs reveals that the best-performing LLM, GPT-4o, performs significantly worse than humans, with only a small portion (1.4\\%) of its answers exactly matching the ground truth. However, it performs nearly perfectly in the first subtask of molecule understanding, achieving accuracy close to 100\\%. This discrepancy highlights the potential of developing advanced LLMs with improved chemical reasoning capabilities in the other two sub-tasks.

In this work, we extend VBMC to deal with noisy log-likelihood evaluations, such as those arising from simulation-based models. We introduce new global' acquisition functions, such as expected information gain (EIG) and variational interquantile range (VIQR), which are robust to noise and can be efficiently evaluated within the VBMC setting. In a novel, challenging, noisy-inference benchmark comprising of a variety of models with real datasets from computational and cognitive neuroscience, VBMC+VIQR achieves state-of-the-art performance in recovering the ground-truth posteriors and model evidence.\nIn particular, our method vastly outperformslocal' acquisition functions and other surrogate-based inference methods while keeping a small algorithmic cost. Our benchmark corroborates VBMC as a general-purpose technique for sample-efficient black-box Bayesian inference also with noisy models.",

In this study, inspired by the success of neural architecture search (NAS), we propose a method to search for data-specific components within subgraph-based frameworks. Specifically, we introduce extensive subgraph selection and encoding spaces that account for the diverse contexts of drug interactions in DDI prediction. To address the challenge of large search spaces and high sampling costs, we design a relaxation mechanism that uses an approximation strategy to efficiently explore optimal subgraph configurations. This approach allows for robust exploration of the search space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, with the discovered subgraphs and encoding functions highlighting the model’s adaptability.",

Leveraging a pre-trained conditional diffusion model that jointly models sequences and structures of antibodies with equivariant neural networks, we propose direct energy-based preference optimization to guide the generation of antibodies with both rational structures and considerable binding affinities to given antigens. Our method involves fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion model using a residue-level decomposed energy preference. Additionally, we employ gradient surgery to address conflicts between various types of energy, such as attraction and repulsion.

The task is of interest to the International Brain Laboratory, a global collaboration of experimental and theoretical neuroscientists studying how the mammalian brain generates behavior. We make four discoveries. First, RNNs learn behavior that is quantitatively similar to ideal Bayesian baselines. Second, RNNs perform inference by learning a two-dimensional subspace defining beliefs about the latent variables. Third, the geometry of RNN dynamics reflects an induced coupling between the two separate inference processes necessary to solve the task. Fourth, we perform model compression through a novel form of knowledge distillation on hidden representations  -- Representations and Dynamics Distillation (RADD)-- to reduce the RNN dynamics to a low-dimensional, highly interpretable model. This technique promises a useful tool for interpretability of high dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems.
