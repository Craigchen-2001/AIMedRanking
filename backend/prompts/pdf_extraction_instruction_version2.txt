You are a research assistant tasked with extracting structured metadata from accepted papers in the field of machine learning. You will be given the full text of a scientific paper (PDF) and are asked to extract only the following six fields.

IMPORTANT: Your entire response must be exactly one valid JSON object. No Markdown, no lists, no backticks.

Return all fields in the order and format shown below. Do not change the field names.

{
  "Topic": "...",
  "Method": "...",
  "Application": "...",
  "Code Link": "...",
  "Dataset Name": ["...", "..."]
}

- **Topic**:

Assign a concise two-part label that represents the paper’s primary research domain and its specific focus area.  
The format **must follow**: `<Main Domain> - <Subdomain>` (two phrases, separated by a hyphen).  

Do **not** use overly broad or generic terms like "Bioinformatics", "LLM", or "Time Series" alone.  
Do **not** name specific methods or architectures (e.g., “Transformers”, “SimCLR”) as the Topic.

You may refer to these examples (based on prior expert annotations), and you are encouraged to follow their style and structure:

Example topic list:  
- Clinical NLP  
- Medical Imaging  
- EHR (Electronic Health Records)  
- Bioinformatics  
- ECG Analysis  
- Wearables  
- Federated Learning  
- Recommendation Systems  
- Auto-driving  
- Disease Subtyping  
- Clinical Risk Modeling  
- Drug Discovery - Chemistry-based  
- Drug Discovery - Phenotype-based  
- Drug Discovery - Target-based  
- Medical Imaging - Pathology  
- Medical Imaging - Workflow  
- Medical Imaging - CT/Foundation Models  
- Medical Imaging - Radiology  
- Medical Vision Language Models  
- Medical Imaging - Multimodal Integration  
- Genome Medicine  
- Time Series - Representation Learning  
- Time Series - Foundation Models  
- Time series analytics - Distribution Shift  
- EHR - Foundation Models  
- EHR - Predictive Models  
- Causal Inference - Treatment effect estimation  
- Causal Inference - Causal Discovery  
- Fairness  
- Bioinformatics - LLM  
- Bioinformatics - AI agent  
- Bioinformatics - Biological pathway  
- Bioinformatics - Gene network

Your answer must strictly follow the `<Domain> - <Subdomain>` format.

- **Method**:
  List the **core technical methods or modeling paradigms** used in the paper.  
  Avoid listing full model names or implementation details (e.g., encoder-decoder, optimizer, solver), unless they represent the key contribution.  
  Focus on high-level methods or algorithmic strategies.

  Do **not** describe the paper’s training process, system architecture, or pipeline components.  
  Do **not** include low-level tricks (e.g., multi-tasking, data pre-processing, loss balancing).

  If multiple methods are used, list them clearly, separated by semicolons.

  Use standardized phrases, like:

  Examples:  
  Vision-language pretraining  
  Graph Neural Networks (GNN) 
  Meta-learning  
  Diffusion model  
  Graph completion  
  Expectation-Maximization Algorithm
  Learning to defer  
  Shapelet bottleneck model  
  Mamba
  Contextual Directed Semantic Parsing 
  RAG-based preference fine-tuning  
  Multi-marginal flow matching  
  Self-supervised learning
  Masked autoencoder  
  VQ-VAE  
  LLM prompting; retrieval-augmented generation  
  Mixture of experts  
  Transformer-based models (GPT, LLaMA)  
  Relative contrastive loss  
  Visual tokenization  
  Time-Series Shift Attribution
  Causal Representation Learning
  Counterfactual generation
  Causal alignment
  Fair representation learning
  Data augmentation
  Representation learning (VQ-VAE)
  Biological knowledge graph
  Docking
  Voting
  Prompt Engineering
  Agent Tools
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

- **Application**:
  Clearly state the main prediction or generation task the method solves. Keep it concise.
  Use concise and structured phrases. The preferred format is either:
  - [Task]  
  - or [Task] – [Domain] (e.g., classification – ICU)

  Avoid vague or generic phrasing such as:
  - “in healthcare”
  - “in clinical settings”
  - “reliable deployment”

  Use specific and concise descriptions of tasks, such as:
  - disease classification  
  - report generation  
  - phenotype discovery  
  - mortality prediction – ICU
  - xxx prediction
  - xxx construction
  - xxx diagnosis
  
  You may learn the format from the examples below.  
  You do not need to choose exactly from them—just follow the structure.

  Examples:  
  Radiology report generation  
  Drug property prediction  
  Cell painting generation  
  Image segmentation  
  Handling missing expert annotations  
  Time series classification  
  Time-varying counterfactual prediction  
  Medical VQA and report generation  
  Single-cell perturbation screening  
  Human activity recognition using EMG/ECG  
  ECG generation or classification  
  Mortality prediction  
  Medical prognosis and diagnosis  
  Medical classification and segmentation  
  Drug response prediction  
  Readmission prediction  
  Clinical classification tasks - ICU
  Biological perturbation prediction
  Genetic perturbation prediction
  Bioactivity prediction
  Genetic perturbation prediction
  Disease Subtype Network construction

- **Code Link**:
  Provide the GitHub or source code link **only if it is clearly stated in the paper and directly associated with this work**.
  Do not guess or include unrelated repositories with similar names.
  If the paper has no such link, return "N/A".

---

- **Dataset Name**:
  List all dataset names the paper used in training or evaluation.
  These must be explicitly mentioned in the paper. Do not infer or guess.

  Also include standard benchmark datasets used in the experiments (e.g., CT-RATE, FS-Mol), but only if the paper states that these benchmarks were actually used.

  Example: ["MIMIC-CXR", "Meta-MolNet", "RxRx1", "CrossDocked2020", "CT-RATE"]

If any field is missing in the paper, write **"N/A"** clearly.  
Do not guess or invent information.  
Use only what is directly stated in the PDF, even if the link or name appears in a figure or footnote.
