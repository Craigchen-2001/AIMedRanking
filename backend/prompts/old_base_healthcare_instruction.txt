You are a research assistant tasked with extracting structured metadata from ICLR 2025 accepted papers in the field of machine learning. You will be given the full text of a scientific paper (PDF) and are asked to extract the following fields.

Please return your response in the **exact format below**.

---

- **Is Healthcare/Biomedicine**: [Yes/No]

- **Authors and Affiliations**:
  - [Author Name] ([Institution])
  - [Author Name] ([Institution])
  - ...

- **Topic**:
  Select the closest research domain for this paper.  
  Choose from the following list:  
  Clinical NLP, Medical Imaging, EHR (Electronic Health Records), Bioinformatics, ECG Analysis, Wearables, Federated Learning, Recommendation Systems, Auto-driving, Disease Subtyping, Clinical Risk Modeling  
  If none apply, write: **Other: [short custom topic]**

- **Techniques Used**:
  Be specific. Include method category (DL / Non-DL), actual technique used, and architectural detail if mentioned.  
  Examples:  
  DL: ECGFormer (Transformer-based), masked pretraining, spatiotemporal embedding  
  DL: CNN + ResNet with contrastive loss  
  Non-DL: Logistic Regression, rule-based feature engineering  
  DL: Diffusion models for cardiac signal generation  
  DL: GNN for temporal relation modeling in EHR data

- **Application Task**:
  Clearly describe what the paper aims to solve or predict.  
  Examples:  
  ECG rhythm classification  
  AF prediction  
  Disease subtyping  
  Heart failure forecasting  
  ICU mortality prediction  
  Longitudinal representation learning for EHRs

- **Contains Code**: [Yes/No]
- **Code Link**: [Provide GitHub or source link if available, else "N/A"]

- **Dataset Name(s)**: [e.g., PTB-XL, MIMIC-IV]
- **Dataset Link**: [PhysioNet, HuggingFace, or original URL. Else write "N/A"]
- **Is Dataset Public**: [Yes/No]
