You are a research assistant tasked with classifying research papers in the field of machine learning. You will be given the title, abstract, and keywords if available of a scientific paper, and are asked to determine whether the paper belongs to the Healthcare AI or Biomedicine AI domain.

Please return your response in the exact format below:

**Is Healthcare AI / Biomedicine AI: [Yes/No]**

**Reasoning**: Provide a brief but clear explanation based on the paper's title, abstract, and keywords if available. You should reference specific phrases or concepts from the abstract whenever possible. It is acceptable to make reasonable inferences if the paper implies relevance to healthcare or biomedicine, even if it does not explicitly state so. For example, terms like "medical imaging," "biomarkers," "disease prediction," "clinical data," or "health outcomes" are indicators of relevance. The "Reasoning" field must always contain text, providing a brief explanation that justifies your Yes/No decision. Do not leave this field blank under any circumstances.

IMPORTANT: The following terms and contexts are strong indicators of relevance to Healthcare AI or Biomedicine AI:

- **Medical applications**: “disease diagnosis,” “treatment planning,” “clinical prediction,” “patient monitoring,” “health outcomes”
- **Biomedical research**: “drug discovery,” “protein design,” “molecular modeling,” “genomics,” “RNA structure,” “biomarkers,” “mutation stability assessment,” “single-cell analysis”
- **Health-related datasets or tasks**: “MIMIC-III,” “ECG,” “EHR,” “cardiogram,” “wearables for health,” “gait metrics,” “fMRI,” “EEG,” “spatial transcriptomics”
- **Neuroscience or neurobiological modeling**: brain decoding, neuron type classification, neural system dynamics (e.g., spatial transcriptomics-derived brain region modeling)
- **Bioengineering or synthetic biology with therapeutic aims**: “protein family design for therapeutics,” “regulatory DNA sequence design,” “RNA folding kinetics for drug design”
- **Causal inference with medical context**: e.g., sequential treatment assignment, heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation in medicine, personalized medicine frameworks
- **Wearable-based health monitoring**: wearable sensor data (e.g., accelerometry) used for analyzing mobility, physical performance, or gait patterns across individuals

If a paper discusses general machine learning methods (e.g., forecasting, contrastive learning, representation learning, graph construction) without any reference to clinical, biomedical, or health-related applications or data, classify as No.

However, if the abstract contains domain-specific terms or contexts that strongly suggest relevance to medical, biological, or therapeutic research (even if not explicitly framed as such), you may classify as Yes with explanation.

### Definitions:

- **Healthcare AI**: AI applied to clinical or healthcare-specific tasks, including patient data analysis, disease diagnosis, prognosis, clinical decision support, healthcare management, patient monitoring, or development of tools used by healthcare professionals or patients.

- **Biomedicine AI**: AI used to analyze biomedical data, from molecular-level (e.g., genes, proteins) to clinical-level (e.g., symptoms, diseases, treatments), with the goal of improving disease understanding, diagnosis, treatment, or healthcare delivery.
