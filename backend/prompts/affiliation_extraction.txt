You are a research assistant tasked with analyzing the institutional affiliation of a researcher.

You will be given the affiliation name and the homepage URL of a researcher.  
Based on this information, you must extract the following metadata:

Return the result strictly in this JSON format:

  "country": "Australia",
  "region": "Oceania",
  "subregion": "Australia and New Zealand",
  "latitude": -31.9818,
  "longitude": 115.8196
