- **Topic**:
    Provide a concise label for the paper’s domain. 
    You may refer to these examples, but you do not have to choose exactly from them:
    Example topic list:
    Clinical NLP
    Medical Imaging
    EHR (Electronic Health Records)
    Bioinformatics
    ECG Analysis
    Wearables
    Federated Learning
    Recommendation Systems
    Auto-driving
    Disease Subtyping
    Clinical Risk Modeling
    Drug Discovery - Chemistry-based
    Drug Discovery - Phenotype-based
    Drug Discovery - Target-based
    Medical Imaging - Pathology
    Medical Imaging - Workflow
    Medical Imaging - CT/Foundation Models
    Medical Vision Language Models
    Medical Imaging - Multimodal Integration
    Genome Medicine
    Time Series - Representation Learning
    Time Series - Foundation Models
    EHR - Foundation Models
    EHR - Predictive Models
    
- **Method**:
  Be specific. Describe the method(s) used in the paper, including the algorithmic approach or model architecture if mentioned. 
    Examples:  
    Vision-language Pretraining
    GNN; meta-learning
    Diffusion models
    Graph completion
    EM algorithm; Learning to defer
    Shapelet Bottleneck Model
    Mamba; CDSP
    RAG-based preference fine-tuning
    Multi-marginal flow matching
    Self-supervised learning; masked autoencoder
    VQ-VAE
    LLM prompting; Retrieval-Augmented Generation
    Mixture of Experts
    Transformer-based models (GPT, LLaMA)
    Relative Contrastive Loss
    Visual Tokenization

- **Application**:
  Clearly describe what the paper aims to solve or predict.   
    Examples:
    Radiology report generation
    Drug property prediction
    Cell painting generation
    Image segmentation
    Handling missing expert annotations
    Time series classification
    Time-varying counterfactual prediction
    Medical VQA and report generation
    Single-cell perturbation screening
    Human activity recognition using EMG/ECG
    ECG generation or classification
    Mortality prediction
    Medical prognosis and diagnosis
    Medical classification and segmentation
    Drug response prediction
    Readmission prediction

- **Code Link**: [Provide GitHub or source link if available, else "N/A"]

- **Dataset Link**: [e.g., PhysioNet, HuggingFace, or paper-provided URL, else "N/A"]
    Extract **only** the URLs that the paper explicitly provides as links to datasets used in this work (e.g., data download pages, API endpoints, GitHub repos).  
    Return a JSON array of strings, each matching the pattern `http://…` or `https://…` exactly as it appears in the PDF.  
    If the paper does **not** include any dataset URLs, return exactly `"N/A"`.  
    **Do NOT** include code links, arXiv links, references to third‐party tools (e.g. RDKit), or any URL not clearly labeled as a dataset download.

If any field is missing in the paper, write **"Not mentioned"** or **"N/A"** clearly.

Use only information from the paper. Do not guess. Do not include explanations or summaries. Just return structured output in the exact format.
