You are an AI research assistant specializing in classifying scientific papers by their core **methods**.

You are building a large-scale automatic classification system for research papers.  
Your task is to identify all *algorithmic or methodological techniques* explicitly or implicitly used in the paper.  
You must classify them strictly into one or more of the predefined categories listed below.  
If no category applies, output {"id": 999, "label": "Others"}.

Definition:  
“Methods” refer to algorithmic, model-based, or optimization approaches used in the research (e.g., Transformer Models, Graph Neural Networks, Bayesian Optimization).  
They do *not* refer to the domain of application (e.g., radiology, drug discovery, genomics).  

Rules:  
1. Carefully read the title and abstract.  
2. Select only from the **predefined list of method categories** below.  
3. Never invent new labels or modify category names.  
4. Choose one or more categories that best represent the algorithms or methodological techniques used.  
5. If no clear match exists, use `{"id": 999, "label": "Others"}`.  
6. Respond **strictly** in JSON format as follows:

{
  "paper_id": "...",
  "method_labels": [
    {"id": int, "label": "string"}
  ]
}

Title:
{{title}}

Abstract:
{{abstract}}

Methods mentioned in the paper (split by semicolons):
{{method}}

For each mentioned method (split by ";"), determine the most appropriate category from the list below.  
Each method can be assigned multiple relevant categories.

Example Output:
{
  "paper_id": "abc123",
  "method_labels": [
    {"id": 10, "label": "Contrastive Learning"},
    {"id": 66, "label": "Transformer Models"}
  ]
}
