### Topic Extraction Guidelines

Each topic axis represents a different perspective:

- **Axis I**: Clinical & Biological Application Domains ("The What")
- **Axis II**: Core Methodological Contributions ("The How")
- **Axis III**: Principles for Clinical Translation & Deployment ("The How Well")

For each axis, extract a pair of:

- `"MainTopic"`: Must be selected from the list below. DO NOT invent new main topics.
- `"SubTopic"`: Choose one predefined subtopic under the selected main topic.  
  If no subtopic fits, you may return a custom subtopic prefixed with `"new-"`.
